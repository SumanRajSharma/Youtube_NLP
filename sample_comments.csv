"I&#39;ll never understand why Hollywood thinks the bad language makes it funnier.  Otherwise, great cast and one of the best movies on Netflix."
Dj?? Just casually throw in a new middle name
I am not a US citizen but I&#39;d definitely vote for you :D
"Ryan&#39;s three favorite things, chicken pot pie"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m58s"">2:58</a> hands on shoulder…"
Love this 😘
"Theres two kinds of guys, the way you can tell is by the way they sit 😂"
And jj purple
I’m not dealing with Chris
Obsessed
Always love watching these interviews while thinking how Brie Larson would ruin the experience had she been there
i would def vote the Rock for pres!<br>idiocracy here we commmmmmme
Kevin hart is crying inside after watching this
the bets and one of the historical movies that i am watching it right now more than 30 times and its interesting<br> i love the INTERPOL guy
The movie was honestly a terrible movie. People see big shot celebrities in a movie and will just watch anything they put out even if it’s terrible. No hate just honest.
Dwayne the Pain Nail Rain the Rock Johnson for President
These the are so cool together...
I love how unapologetically Jewish Gal Gadot is...
I’ve never seen a guy sit like Ryan
Why does Ryan remind me of Dr House?? 😁😍
"Ryan changed comedy! Hes a player on his own field. so unique! Crafty, witty, subtle offensive that sneaks in for a kiss - kinda like indian spicy where its good but later you fee"
Sadhguru.
"Those three are a great team, i hope for a sequel!"
Abkmv ujdyj!
"We all know DJ would be a chef of some kind if he wasn&#39;t an actor, why you ask? Well because I am sure we all know what the rock is cooking...."
"we dont appreciate your joke about Timmy, Ryan!"
i love their chemistry so much!!
"well Ryan chose a wrong job if he hates airplanes lol<br>and strange that even dwayne himself didnt wrote &quot;boxer&quot; as a job he would do, i was like guys cmon president and general, he is a boxer , but nope not even himself wrote that.. good ol days were forgotten :/ he was following his pop&#39;s footsteps back in the day"
🤨
"I love all three of these actors, but it&#39;s a shame Netflix made a heap of garbage."
I had to watch this three times to understand it. The first time I was too distracted by my dream woman Gal Gadot and the second time I was too distracted by my dream man Ryan. LOL
I love this!!!
Ryan content. Love to see it.
"Ryan said sneakers at the end there, I smell a new guest on Sneaker Shopping with Complex that they should definitely hop on if they&#39;re smart at all"
What on earth are mixers
Gal’s little “I’m done” is the cutest.
Gal Gadot inspires me to improve my English
The Rock definitely hit that.
Wonder Woman likes the Rock🙃
Gal gadot🥰
I don’t like Gal
Please make more movies together..
Its obvious dj would be a wrestler if he wasn’t an actor
"The Rick the coolest, who&#39;s with me 🌼"
Did anyone else watch this god awful movie and then instantly get this video recommended?
I cannot take my eyes off Gal. She&#39;s stunning!
masking? 6 feet?
funniest part was &quot;I give you an update on the score. its 0 to 0 to 0&quot; lol 😂
"This movie was awesome, what an awesome trio"
Man gal is annoying
"I saw a C.T. V. Interview where Dwayne Johnson tried out for the N.F.L. Did not get in and played for Calgary and got <br>Wally was his coach,lives in Hawaii and that is where Dwayne settled."
We’ve known each other for so long
Gotta love Gal !<br>חס וחלילה טפו טפו טפו
Its weird to hear them call Dwyane &quot;DJ&quot; the whole time. I&#39;ve never heard anyone address him like that before.
Ryan does it everytime.. 😂
I get a sense that these three really genuinely enjoyed filming this movie.
Irrelevant celebrities.
dammit i smile the whole video
"Not big on Aviation, Ryan`?"
Gal is so adorable. &quot;Fear of Ryan is losing loved ones. God forbid! Tfu-tfu-tfu&quot; ❤️
I can&#39;t wait to show you all the wonders of the rope
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m45s"">2:45</a> the way Ryan just left rocks hand hanging"
This is like a family interview with Ryan as thier 5 year old kid
Blake really gotta steal our happiness
Theyre all such beautiful people inside and out
Oh man I’d love to get drunk with these three
Maui Guy and Shank
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m50s"">2:50</a> listen what gal said lol red notice 2  coming"
"In this interview;<br>Gal seemed like the quiet, intelligent girl at school<br>Ryan like the class clown<br>And DJ as the peaceful teacher out there 😅"
Gal is the hottest thing this side of the sun
This needed to be sponsored by Manscaped like every other video on YouTube
Did anybody knows what kind jacket rock wearing ..?
I would LOVE to see that bad impressionssss
Gal Gadot outfit though 🤩
“Aviation” Gin. Ryan’s company. And airplanes are his fear lol.
I am surprised Ryan is still in character... oh wait he always acts like that.
Ryan is third wheeling so hard
Gal is so gorgeous 😍
The look DJ gave them both when he heard pie tho 😂 he was channeling that old Rock promo energy
The three most fabulous people on earth...beautyful inside and outside!!! My humble opinion...
What s soul Dj ❤️
Ya know let&#39;s give a shout out to the wardrobe guys who had to find the rock clothes...they look like they&#39;re always in a life and death struggle to contain him
3 of my favorite  people together
ryan reynold is now like hulk
גל: חס וחלילה טפו טפו טפו<br>ראיין: yeah yeah
"Why does this sound like if the Muppets did karaoke lol <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=5m13s"">5:13</a>"
Yousuf is a noob
"You guys are hilarious, I loved the relaxed fun and genuineness!!   Thank you guys!"
Love their chemistry. Here&#39;s to hoping for Red Notice 2 ❤️❤️❤️
"Weird.... Google translate translated &quot;knicking&quot; as &quot;knocking&quot; in my language. Could this be true? Is he really that harsh on his balls? Cheesus Crust, that&#39;s a little... Unsettling, to say the least."
Ryan : Wuuuaaaaaooooo.
"How come deadpool is in every movie lately? Ryan, it&#39;s time to try other characters"
Funny thing....One of these 3 is a Billionaire.....
Sitting with nerves of steel<br>also muscels<br>Die.<br>....haiku?
Bro Ryan is a whole mood
presidant ?? ^^
Dwayne Johnson&#39;s manspreading 😂
"DJ &quot;if i wasnt an actor, what would i do for a living?&quot; uh...just a hypothetical guess...maybe wrestling?"
"The film pretty much sucks, but these guys are great."
These are the three actors I wish to never see!  So sick of them!
Ryan/booth was my favourite character
always thought I was not &#39;lady like&#39; coz I can&#39;t do it. Seeing Gal sit that way makes me feel good
"scared of planes, ceo of Aviator Gin kekeke"
Ryan ma man! You are scared of airplanes and yet you have a Gin and you named it Aviation....ahhh I see what you doing there 😅
I won…. I said Heights for Ryan and Abs for the hot chick
I want adam Sandler- ryan Reynolds movie!😁
She looks like an android created in a laboratory designed to maximize cuteness and sexiness simultaneously. This can&#39;t be a real person.
Just watched red notice on Netflix  it&#39;s a dope movie 💯🤟🏻
The rock looking a little pale here...
This was really good I enjoyed it Red Notice  was fantastic and I’m looking forward to seeing them again. It looks like it’s the start of a beautiful relationship for them
That dance scene was amazing!
"I&#39;m pretty sure that if haki was real, The Rock would have a HUGE Conqueror&#39;s haki, this dude is just badass by doing literally nothing."
Sneakers 👍👍👍
"Gadot&#39;s voice at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=7m45s"">7:45</a> 🙂🌹🥺🥺🥺"
Freemasons all
Ryan is the reason I&#39;m here
So the result is they don&#39;t know anything about each other after casting a whole movie 🤣
"Is it just me or do these three not have ANY chemistry whatsoever! I must be wrong, maybe this interview is weird"
ryan  i  so  funny
Hope they add Chris Pine to Red Notice 3 🚘
That opening line on Thimothée Chalamet tho... 😂
Gal’s little “I’m done” is the cutest.
I would love to see these great actors on hot ones. Eating spicy wings.🥰🤗
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m26s"">3:26</a> well no hate bro, but ur not an actor 😂😂 at all."
Thanks for the video
Yasssssss! Ryan’s karaoke song is mine too!
gal is stunning here.
Gal and DJ touchy touchy makes me wonder 🤔🤔
Omy god... Hey guys
So - they skate straight past the “Shaving private Ryan” joke.. wasted opportunity..
I like how Ryan and Gal are sitting the same way lol
hot garbage
This could’ve been a good movie if that woman who can not act was not part of it.
"chas vechalila  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m55s"">0:55</a>"
Lets be honest. Gal is third wheeling here
"Close ur legs a bit, Rock."
Hold On by Wilson Phillip&#39;s is my favorite karoke song. Respect.
"Ryan is funny asf, Gal is charming and THE ROCK IS THE ROCK"
Dwane whats something that makes me always laugh : &#39;&#39; Kevin Hart&#39;&#39;
Ryan Reynolds is so hot.
You know a movie is gonna flop hard and cost the studio tonnes of millions when they keep up the pointless marketing push like this!!!
Ryan Reynolds has good chemistry with everyone
Ryan is no different than the character he represented lol.
What an awesome cast
Dislike.  No one cares Vanity Fair
It took me until today to realize that Vanity Fair wasn’t a made up news source in Iron Man. Can I have a meet and greet with Christine Everhart? 😂
"Hey, look at this. Wonder Woman, Green Lantern And Black Adam sitting side by side. Wow... The League is getting real. 😁"
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pure"">#PURE</a> BLOODS stay STRONG 💪 Say no to the JAB"
"This is so weird. My fathers name is dawyne, my grandmas name is gail, and my brother name is ryan. How the f*ck is this possible"
Gal Gadot is so beautiful pls 😭😭
Whenever Ryan says &quot;Wow&quot; I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s genuine or sarcastic lmaoo
Yes Ryan is my best hollywood actor
They all so funny they should all play super hero movie together  or be add to the expandables4
I hope they don&#39;t make a sequel.
This settler doesn’t even know how to act
Ryan keeping it real af lol with the whole &quot;your not in there budget lol&quot; it&#39;s true.
"I paused at Dwayne&#39;s first question waiting for wrestling, let&#39;s watch..."
Gal looks very noble dressed this way 😀
גל צנועה ויפה פה 😍
"the combination of these three was wholesome, rlly enjoyed this interview 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"
Ryan is Owe Wilson confirmed &quot;Wow&quot;
Hope they do sequels. I like them together
Ohh gosh i love this triooooo
Kevin Hart and DJ still the top duo
Is it just me or the Rock is too cautious than his usual open and aggressively funny behaviour?
"that was wierd, but fun"
My favorite scene: Doooown Toooown 😜
When u put three genuinely nice people in Hollywood together
way too cheesy
The Rock knows all about pie
"Gal Gadot is awesome, Israelis are so cool! Great attitude :)"
is gal actally dating dwane
These 3 are great together!
Hahahahaha 🤣🤣🤣
dislike
That movie was crap
If you weren’t an actor….. you would all probably still have your souls. 👁
RYAN IS SO FUNNY
I think we can all appreciate Rock&#39;s pants for holding on for dear life.
Men: you aren&#39;t supposed to act like Ryan Reynolds.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m10s"">0:10</a> &quot;Kal-El, NoOoOoOo..&quot;"
"RYAN IS A LEGEND, GAL IS AN ANGEL, DJ IS A DJ"
"Gal&#39;s voice is like honey... I love her tone and accent<br>I also love how The Rock throws compliments right back at her all the time. We need a buddy cop comedy with those two, or even better, a remake of True Lies! ahaha"
Ryan is cool but the other 2 are unfortunately sellouts....
I like how they call him D.J
I like the accent of Gal
"she calls him dj, i think she likes him!!"
"Cool seeing them interact, how to see more of them acting together."
"Everyone was super chill, but I have a feeling this was their millionth interview of the day lol"
I was sure Ryan spends most on Hugh Jackman hate ads. :D
manspreading all his manliness i hope im between those rocky balls
Go away you all are over exposed
Deadpool forgot to act like Ryan. <br>There is a term for actors who can’t break out of a character but I forget what it is…
"Gal Gadot, please marry me🤣💀"
&#39;I&#39;m scared of flying&#39;. Aviation Gin. Ryan Reynolds
We learned that they learned nothing about one another working together. HOLLYWOOD!!
ryan reynolds <b>hates airplanes</b><br>also ryan reynolds <b>names his gin company aviation</b>
Hi Maui as in Dwayne
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m55s"">0:55</a> Allah korusun tu tu tu.."
Define-Dwayne Johnson <br><br>Best Actor on earth
I wonder if gal fadot ever become the presidant
The one in the middle is a IDF war criminal.
"Nice team, Godbless"
"Is it just me or does The Rock never take a compliment? I guess he&#39;s trying to be nice, but it really comes off as annoying"
Presidant of the USA....well thats a fail...
What a cool passage
"Whats with the cameltoe Rockyboy? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=6m38s"">6:38</a>"
dead pool looks like a third wheel!
Imagine all the people loving Gal Gadot
Them calling Dwayne DJ is the cutest thing to me I don’t know why
marvel dc crossover
"Just about 3 of the nicest people in Hollywood,... I would fathom."
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"a canadian, a jew and a samoan walk int... wait a minute"
The rock looks weird with makeup on
Ryan&#39;s humor is simple but hilarious.
Gal gadot is not funny.. thats a fact
TRASH LOVES TRASH
i’m such a fan of the rock. i think he’s just the kind of guy who is good to everyone and always tries to do good in everything he does. he emits this air of positivity. seems like a humble guy too
Red notice is the stupidest movie of all times.
To think we have Deadpool Wonderwoman and Black Adam
DJ for president!
"Tragiczny ten film, jest tak zły ze nie obejrzałem do końca."
Burn Hollywood
Man. I would love to just hang around all three of these people!!!
He didn&#39;t wrestling because that&#39;s acting too.
Can&#39;t wait till Ryan does a story comedy tour.
"Rolls Royce, Good Game and DJ"
Gal so fine man
Ryan would have won no matter what happened
"I <i>love</i> the ‘warding away evil’ thing Gal does @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m55s"">0:55</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m57s"">0:57</a>. 😊"
"Ryan, Gal and Dwayn. The combination I didn’t know I wanted, but I’m glad exists. They’re just so perfect together."
Dwayne loves Rayan is wholesome. My eyes filled
Gal’s little “I’m done” is the cutest.
I really like the actors - but the Red Notice movie was lame and obviously quick and dirty for easy release.  NO scene really made sense within the plot and the characters.  The producer and writers spewed out crap.
🙄
They’re all so cute ❤️
These three are just awesome and hands down amazing! love you guys!!!!
"DJ: If I wasn&#39;t an actor, what would I do for a living? A wrestler!"
did you catch gal gadot &quot;next time we&#39;ll sing too&quot;
If dwayne was’nt an actor he would still be throwing barrels at super mario.
i loved this movie it was fricken hilarious😭
This was hilarious 😂 I wish this was 2-3 hours long 😆😆
Complex after watching this 🤯🤯🤯
I like how the other 2 refer to him as DJ. It&#39;s like a grade school nickname
all superheroes lol
If I wasn’t an actor what would I do for a living<br>Me: Go back to WWE
Ryan is my crush 😪.
I&#39;m in love with Gal Gadot
"HAL Jordan, DIANA Prince and the Toothfairy"
Gal is so beautiful
why am i seeing this as Deadpool meets Wonder Woman and Black Adam?
"Bro, Gal just randomly throwing in Hebrew is so great."
~*wowwwwww*~
"TBH this is the best cast ever, and the movie was amazing."
"Seen here, Rock&#39;s camel toe."
Dwayne and Ryan are 2 actors that play themselves every film
W
Red notice
Blessings 🙏 Jesus Christ Saves Souls 🙏 1st Corinthians Ch15 Verses1-4 KJV
Ryan: &quot;I highly doubt you are in their budget&quot; 😂
Gal looks so much like geo antoinette here
the trio we didnt ask for but needed it
Palestine
Ryan is really an amazing and funny actor😄😇<br>In Red notice i really loved Ryans charcter a lot😱❤🔥
Ryan knows how to stole the show.
"I use to admire DJ and he use to make me laugh now I can&#39;t even enjoy his movies anymore. The illusion is gone the honeymoon is over. You would think actors are more well rounded individuals but they are just cut throat, self absorbed morons. I&#39;m not sure you can blame them for the way they turn out but just realize they are awful people."
I guessed sneakers
Red Notice was 🔥🔥🔥 love these two guys (and gal).
Nobody gives a crap about Gal Godot and her answers.. I didn’t even listen to her.. Ryan is the man!
Gal misspellt president
I love how gal and Ryan are just sitting there like lady’s while Dwayne is just sitting there all manly with his legs wide open lol
Gal is so adorable. &quot;Fear of Ryan is losing loved ones. God forbid! Tfu-tfu-tfu&quot; ❤️
Shut up wy te  people
Never expected Dwayne to be a Haiku Poet.
I really enjoyed the Marvel interviews.
I just now saw this and couldn&#39;t believe the language I&#39;m hearing. I don&#39;t think any of them are going to show this to their small kids. It was good though.
&quot;Couple of Uncles&quot;
Wow
Gal&#39;s outfit is stunning!
Ryan is the Funniest Guy that i have seen in Hollywood. I literally watch this Movie becz of him. He is a Genius at Joking and Laughing People. 👍👍👍
Isn&#39;t she the one that killed innocent people and kids ?
A better title for this video &quot;2 really good actors and some chick with an accent who was in two really bad movies but otherwise has almost no credits to her name&quot;
Loved watch Red Notice!   Hope there will be a sequel.
"Deadpool, wonderwoman and black adam."
DJ is so fake of a human being.
Omg I just enjoy these three together so muchhhh 😂
I would’ve guessed wham for the music😂
"Kevin wouldve been a great addition to this group,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Ryan Reynolds is a pure advert for confidence gets you anywhere. Very talented and cool guy.
RYAN REYNOLDS IS OVERRATED
Ryan reynolds is the only person to not play a role because his personality is enough for a movie
"deadpool, Wonder Woman and Black Adam"
Netflix needs to release Ryan’s impressions of DJ💀
Ryan Reynolds is under paid
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m55s"">0:55</a> חס וחלילה טפו טפו טפו אני לא נושמת"
"I’m doing abs watching this video, gal hmu"
Gal has me dreaming...
"Really tryna hold onto that DJ nickname  🤣, maybe if you say it it&#39;ll make more people think he really goes by that behind scenes every since ol&#39; Sleepy called him that soooo &quot;sincerely&quot; bwahhaaahaha nice try guys!"
🥱
I love these three. Red Notice is my favorite movie. ♥ Gal Gadot ♥
Me a straight dude excited for Gal Gadot <br>ends up simping for for Ryan 😭 .
ryan is so funny
Такое гавно сняли)))
I love how Ryan hates Airplanes but sells Aviation Gin.
Ryan voice he is real dead pool
I was so confused for like half of the video cause I was like?? who is DJ???? but then.... I realized it&#39;s dwayne johnson lmao I&#39;m dead
Gal gadot is fine asl😭
Gal gadot i  is really a big mess in the movie not a suitable for those actors.. she just doesn’t fit in.. 🤦🏻
Gal gadot is just perfection
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=7m10s"">7:10</a> plot twist: it made it to the movie"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m15s"">3:15</a> <b>THE GAME PLAN</b> OMG"
are we calling the rock DJ now or is that just is friends?
Ryan: &quot;sneakers would be my biggest expense&quot;. Also the same guy who has just bought Wrexham football club. 😂
the best movie with the best cast.... literally my favorite 2021 movie
They are happy together
Ryan and his sense of humor is making my life 2x better
Seria tão legal se fosse legendado.
why would anyone trade soul for few minutes of fame and WHY WOULD YOU IDOLISE SOMEONE LIKE THAT.......
"omg, what universe are we in..?"
genocide barbie
Gal smile is so 🤩😍
red notice 2!!!
He really just said &quot;like butter&quot; 😌👌
Imagine Ryan said his biggest fear was if green lantern got a sequel
"Anyone else just seeing Deadpool, Wonder Woman and Black Adam just sitting down in a room 🤔 😍😊"
"The Rock is spoken by Obama :-), completely the same voice"
How much lighting do you want?<br>Vanity fair: yes
I went through a lot of comments checking if anyone else caught how Gal wrote &#39;President&#39; but I guess I&#39;m the pettiest one here.
:) awesome
"Wonder woman, black adam, and green lantern<br>Or deadpool🤣🤣"
"kevin hart is somewhere in the corner, crying"
They are the kings and
Nobody <br>Gal - Aww
Sneakers! I got it
Gal Gadot is a DIFFERENT BREED OF HUMAN 🥺😍 IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE SHE IS HUMAN!! 😩
8
Red Notice  2 please😅😛
red notice needs another movie :_: sooner 😭
"Hey, Mrs Gal.. DJ is expert at making pie, the POOMTANG PIE.. you must smell what DJ is cooooooking"
"Enjoyed the movie, enjoyed time with these fun authentic actors"
"Deadpool with Wonder Woman and Black Adam, just make a movie together! I don&#39;t care if it makes sense I would watch it!"
Fake
I don&#39;t know why this doesn&#39;t look like Gal Gadot
"After watching the movie, I still have that feeling they’ll double cross each other again 💀💀"
I thought Ryan would spent the most money on his hair by making it look good yk
the rocks biggest fear is mr socko
Would love to see Gal and Ryan in a RomCom movie 😍
I liked the movie 😊
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=4m53s"">4:53</a>. So cute, Gal Grooving to the spice girls"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=4m58s"">4:58</a><br><br>Lol"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m18s"">3:18</a>. I like how Ryan spoilt the market"
who the eff is DJ? <br><br>Ohh..
I like Ryan Reynolds but the man is the same character in almost every movie he has ever done same as Dwayne Johnson 🤔 These Hollywood people keep making the same movie again and again. Ryan is a bit overrated
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a>"
so the point is they do not know each other
"Deadpool(Green Lantern), Wonder Woman, Black Adam"
When gal was asked about fav scene in the movie i was expecting dj or ryan talking about that dance scene … but she was the one at last 🤣🤣 she must have really moved by rock’s big muscle 😆
"Just watched red notice, great movie, excited for the sequel"
yow I can never see the back of the rocks head normal after that Ryan Reynolds joke in the movie lol
Ryan IS the reason Deadpool is my #1 anti-Superhero Superhero. He IS Deadpool/Wade Wilson IRL &amp; he is FOREVER one of my favorites.
Ryan is every completely happy straight mans fear to meet.
I’m just surprised that a Netflix original was good. Like really good.
Ryan just being Ryan Reynolds
Okay but anyone haven&#39;t watch the movie and came here to just see the cast?
Bautista is a better Actor then The Rock 🤷🏿
The Chemistry between these 3 is like MSN vibes
I love the them all - but Ryan is the best
That man spread 😆
"Think Gal needs some spelling lessons, Presidant????"
The rock movies are all the same a run down chase movie or they&#39;re searching for something all the same movies how about a horror or thriller movie some times Hollywood new era of movies suck a**

"deadpool, wonder woman and black adam. This is so cool"
What would Dwayne be if he wasn&#39;t an actor? A WRESTLER DUH!!! I&#39;m surprised either of them didn&#39;t say that lol
We gonna
Gaga0
gal’s “tfu tfu tfu” lmaooooo
Gal just drips of her Jew privilege
The big guy tries too hard.
Love RYAN LOL
I&#39;d saw her in half
dwayne sitting there with his legs wide open lmao
Давай перевод
😍😍
The movie was way too predictable. Thumbs down on this one
"Let&#39;s be real, Gal would make a better president than our current one. Kinda hard to do worse anyway."
I love the chemistry with this group
I love Gal&#39;s hair
HILARIOUS 😄
Rock&#39;s face when Ryan said he spends money on Pie 😂
Isnt the rock sopposde to be getting ready for black adam
DJ = Donald John (Trump)
"I hate Ryan, after dead Pool, but he is amazing actor 👏"
Gal is so pretty 😍
This makes me want to watch the movie again lol
Has anyone else hit “Ryan Reynolds Fatigue” yet?
<b>&quot;What did Maui meant by Hookers and Blows?&quot;</b>
I’m here just thinking that Ryan Reynolds and Jake Peralta would be some good friends
Red Notice is a godly movie
The Rock was thinking about saying something else in regards to spending money on Pie lol.
i also have a fear of airplanes
"As much as would normally think actors are always putting on a show in public, I&#39;m getting the feeling the connection between these 3 is seriously genuine. This was fun to watch!"
Gal so ignore whole time the bold man!
celebrities are so pre-Covid. They helped sell the destruction of millions of people&#39;s lives with lockdowns while singing like fools. Loss of liberty and the embrace of tyranny is getting real old.
RR has the single best personality to make it through life. I&#39;d give anything to be half as personable
Love them❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰⭐️⭐️🙏🏾
Apa yang telah dipersatukan Tuhan  tidak boleh dipisahkan oleh manusia.
A bunch of satanic illuminati perverts. Hollyweird is dead folks and these people are fakes
חס וחלילה טפו טפו טפו
I want more Ryan Reynolds movies
How are you scared of airplanes but named your gin Aviation?
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/6KqNB4Nkk9M"">https://youtu.be/6KqNB4Nkk9M</a>"
this whole time i was like who the heck is dj and it was Dwayne Johnson lol
"As boring as an interview could be for these 3 standards, but Reynolds is still funniest person alive and Johnson is coolest and classiest dude ever and was fun to listen to. Can’t go wrong with these 3."
Il circolo vola?
These 3 are extremely entertaining. My congrats to all 3 on their success and their love for their fans!!!
Red Notice was pure DR-R-R-R-R-R-ECK!... each of them were paid 20 mil for this mess. Reviews are pretty horrible. Must Reynolds play Deadpool in EVERY film?
They acted so well in red notice.
Gal is one fine lady…but she can’t act.. neither can the rock
"This movie in a nutshell:<br>This movies starring Dwayne Johnson as himself, Ryan Reynolds as himself and Gal Gadot as herself."
If DJ wasn&#39;t a actor what would he be? Errr Wrestler? American Footballer? No?
"gal galdot haircut , i lik e that"
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard DeWayne curse before. I mean I have in Baywatch but not like in the interview.
"I had voted for D.J. when I voted. I voted for him and Keanu Reeves. I wanted to vote for great humans to represent our country, and inspire our country to heal."
Gal Gadot. Any time.
&quot;What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? <br>Bill Gates : You get what you f**kin&#39; deserve!&quot;
I don’t know why but that woman is just incredibly annoying for some reason.
Gal is so feminine and natural and perfect ….. if i would look into her eyes and her smiling back to me i would be lost for days for sure lol 😂
The commie rock.
Love how the rock is just man spreading 💀
"Anyone big on land grabs and supporting fascists? Yes, Gal Gadot"
Anyone catch that 1 scene where Ryan has a bottle of his aviator gin on the table?....lol
Door to door pumpkin salesman🤣<br>Ryan at his best😂😂
Iw byslecsic
DJ and Gal: Ryan is a very family man Ryan: SNICKERS
"I&#39;ve never heard of the Rock being referred to as DJ.  I mean, they&#39;re his initials, but I&#39;m just not used to it."
Bryan Reynolds is a more gooder actor then I thought he we’re.

"Dwayne, buddy, it’s any scene with Ryan and me, not Ryan and I.<br><br>The attempt to sound more formal makes it incorrect."
L&#39;actrice ce retourne toujours vers Ryan comme quoi les muscles ne sont pas toujours gage d&#39;attirance pour les femmes !
Gal is so freaking gorgeous.
"What&#39;s with the &quot;man spreading?&quot; Awkward! Dudes, btw. that&#39;s not cool."
Gal is just ... 😍🤩 Is she even real
Can we plz get a supercut of all Ryan&#39;s impressions of DJ on the set?
레드노티스 개노잼이다 보지마라
🙄
Ryan is my spirit animal
I seriously love how dwayne is the nicest person in the world
"Instead of red notice story, I found Ryan Reynolds dads story sounded more interesting."
Was I the only one who was personally hurt by the plot twist
Too bad this movie blew
"What is it, do you want to make a sardine factory?"
Ryan has morphed ...he now is at the point.. &quot;All he needs is a fire arm..and he is just DeadPool in regular clothes&quot;
IS ABOUT DRIVE ITS ABOUT POWER
Gals eye contact with Ryan is like a teenager looking at her crush...she rarely stares at the Rock in this interview
U make me look like Timothee chalmate....i didn&#39;t understand<br>Did he mean u make me look short
Ryan Reynolds playing Deadpool:❎<br><br>Deadpool playing Ryan Reynolds:✅
Now I wanna see Ryan&#39;s shoe collection. @complex

"I&#39;ve seen different recommendations about William&#39;s Armstrong Trading services, he will be very exceptional for people to talk this good about him"
🇺🇸①②⑥ⓞ②⑦④⑥⑤④⑦
William&#39;s Armstrong he&#39;s availability is on WhatsApp.. I&#39;ll drop his number on top of my next comment 👆👆
"This is a good info, thanks for the recommendation, but how do I reach them?"
"Same here I earn huge weekly profits of $10,000 on my Investment since I started trading with William&#39;s Armstrong he&#39;s trading strategies are top- notch."
"I&#39;m happy to see William&#39;s Armstrong mentioned here, my spouse recommended him to me after investing $4000 and he has really helped us financially in the times of COVID-19 lockdown here in Australia."
"as a newbie investing in crypto will be the best for you, I know of a portfolio / investment manager, William&#39;s Armstrong Trading services, an expertise in trade investment as you don&#39;t have to under go any stress in..."
"You don&#39;t really need someone to tell you how to invest your coin, you can make a research on your own and also try doing it yourself first."
"I understand the fact that tomorrow isn&#39;t promised to anyone, but investing today is a hard thing to do because I have no idea of how and where to invest in"
"Money is an issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life, life was hard for me until I started trading Shiba Inu and am now earning $20,000 per week."
"Let&#39;s make it official, Gal Gadot is the most beautiful woman in the world."
Ryan is all about &quot;wow&quot;
gal gadot :*
Deadpool being deadpool for 9minutes
"In addition, you might want to enhance all of this with one of the many all-natural solutions, like the one revealed by Mario Volpstein. Try go&#39;ogling him, although it&#39;s often forgotten, the results are terrifyingly good."
"Guess where the $200 Million budget for this movie went?, spoiler Alert didn&#39;t go on the movie!"
Wait…. Was Ryan an Airborne in the Army. ?
what a legendary trio
Kekw <br>Great movie
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m34s"">3:34</a> Bouncer in a nightclub!"
They are weirdly nice
Ryan seems like the kind of guy that makes random accounts on YouTube and trolls everyone but he probably won’t have the time to do that.
GOATS‼️
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/z9hRZE5cWRg.......A-PEx/Horror"">https://youtu.be/z9hRZE5cWRg.......A-PEx/Horror</a> Movie"

"Can someone translate what she said at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m55s"">0:55</a> after &#39;god forbid&#39;. Thanks!"
this is bad
So there were no correct answers?
Gal godot.....cringe....cant stand her
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m27s"">3:27</a> I thought the answer. Would be. Wrestler"
"Ryan Reynolds is the Adam Sandler of Action Comedy, he has the same comedic character on all of his movies, but i still watch them all."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m30s"">3:30</a>. You hardly see Gal sit like that !"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m38s"">3:38</a>. Dwyane really appreciate it!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m22s"">2:22</a>. Dwayne is a sweet guy!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m18s"">3:18</a>. I highly doubt it"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=1m35s"">1:35</a>. But deadpool 2 he have a plane jumping scene?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=1m01s"">1:01</a><br><br>Couple of uncles?"
Ok I think Dwayne forgot that he was a wrestler before he was an actor
Gal and DJ gettin it down no doubt
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=1m20s"">1:20</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=1m40s"">1:40</a> tf??? He&#39;s legit lucky to be alive LOL. Although the more you fly, of course the more you&#39;ll see crazy turbulence."
"So this is what happens when an American, an Israeli and a Samoan get together in a room."
"Deadpool ,Wonder Woman &amp; Black Adam"
"I just realised that we have Deadpool , Wonder Woman and the Black Adam  together here 😅"
So no one gonna talk about how when she was talking about the dancing she said in the next one and then it cut a few seconds later
What s your biggest expenditure Ryan ? Erm sneakers i spent more on them in 12 month than i spent on Wrexham
"these guys are brilliant, great and dedicated people fur sure. couple of Oscars on each. they look very happy, but they fight a lot as well. sorry i think i have a lasso of Truth too. most people fight a lot these days, and Great Mature People keep telling me, just make a lovely child landscape face, you&#39;re gonna see a whole lot more of this fur sure. that&#39;s just how  powerful people are really, they never age, but they&#39;re forever 30 something boys. well, what to do? am not 16 forever in my mind?????? so."
"I don&#39;t understand how Ryan is so funny, the guy literally cracks me up every time, such a likeable person."
I hate Israel
Gal is just so angelic my word...&quot;losing a loved one&quot;
this is good but movie sucks....
"compared to DJ and Ryan, Gal is not funny"
"I would watch anything.. Just put BA, Deadpool and WW in it."
Hello Dwayne the Rock Johnson Dwayne the Rock Johnson is cool
Even in real life .........my mind is still in a movies motion for Ryan Reynolds he is natural
Now I want Dwayne to be a Haku poet.
Dwane Johnston what a joke
"What a Trio,,, Black  Adam, Wonder Women &amp; Deadpool.... Amazing😀"
"I just finished watching their new movies RED NOTICE, and I give a 10 out of 10!!!  :)"
Hmmmmmmmm😂😂😂😂
I want a Ryan and Kevin Hart movies for some reason.
😂😂😂😂😂
"I love how Ryan&#39;s personality is still the same when in front of the camera and not, the humorous and talkative kind."
How tf is gal that beautiful
I’m here for Ryan’s chaotic neutral energy. This guy’s pure gold !
It&#39;s all fun and games untill Dwayne actually becomes a poet.
cerita paling mengarut aku pernah tengok.. x best langsung. cliche sangat.. macam cerita perompak2 lain<br><br>Eng translte : the best movie i&#39;ve ever watched... not so cliche like other thieves movies...
This movie was actually very entertaining!
Seems a bit cringe because they really don&#39;t know each other and it looks like they irritated each other quite a bit. Or maybe it&#39;s an over analysis
haha Nice
"They&#39;re all very talented indeed, but none of them should try singing, EVER!!! 🤣"
Gal&#39;s as gorgeous as always.
So funny interview! 🤩😆
Gal Gadot is very beautiful 👍
"ended with a, &quot;Now that&#39;s a GOOD ending&quot; at the very end. I am looking forward to a part 2, 3, 4, 5!!!!"
I love how they call Dwayne “Dj” 😭🥰
"Main characters: One Canadian, one American and one Israeli."
I need that leather jacket ! Somebody?
Gale is so beautiful like as a person lol
Its v entertaining movie
"We need a Underground 6, Money Heist and Fast and The Furious crossover 😍 that would be sick 👌"
Imagine Dwayne with the little hat 🤣🤣
Newsflash: were over Hollywood and people you ram down our throats
Dwayne loves pie too. Poontang..
I don&#39;t like aeroplanes and heights fortunately I&#39;m sat down all the time so it&#39;s cool
The rock looks like an alien that came to enslave the planet.
President rock. The people’s legislative agenda 🤣
THE CHEMISTRY OF THESE THREE OH MY GOD
We are one EXO(OT10)
They&#39;re chemistry Is amazing. Love Reynold&#39;s is so witty.
Gals outfit!!! Slayyyy
"I still find it strange to see Ryan and Dwayne in the same room, let alone a movie"
they get along..because they aren&#39;t trying too hard here to show that they get along...!
ryan is at a point where he doesnt even have to try to make people laugh. Just being himself is enough<br>dude cracks me up even before he gets to the punchline
טפו טפו טפו
"No, Ryan&#39;s greatest fear is green lantern"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m56s"">0:56</a> &quot;тфу-тфу-тфу&quot; чтоб не сглазить 😂"
nobody else now wondering why ryans company is aviation gin if he hates airplanes? weird coincidence maybe?
Ryan is the ONLY dude in Hollywood that can get a pass for sitting like a woman with his legs crossed lmao
DJ: We know each other so much <br><br>Ryan won the game with 1 point. Lol
The Rock for president
Dwayne Johnson for president
After kevin hart i love ryan and dj combo . I love itt
"Omg, Baby I love you by the yahoos has been my fav for years! Woot!"
♥️🙏
the rock touched her leg without getting her consent.  someone tell Alysa Milano!
Pencipta asli kah?
Total: 1 point
"Not a slam against them at all, but I feel Ryan, Gal, and Dwayne must be so sick of these garbage interviews.  They made a movie, just let them get on with their lives.  Why make them answer these moronic questions?"
How is Ryan the hottest in the room wen the rock and gal are in the same room
Lame
I LOVE Ryan! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
This movie is super cliche` it makes me vomit.
We ignoring the &quot;DJ&quot; thing? ... okay just checking
"Is it just me who can&#39;t tell Ryan Reynolds and John Krasinski apart. They look, joke and talk so much alike. Are they related?"
Gal Gadot was part of an army battalion in Israel that killed Arab children and journalists. <br>Just staying .
"I would have thought Reynolds spent more money on hair products then anything else . this was fun to watch thanks all of you , Red Notice was great"
Gal gadott gada obat
The rock is getting old 😂💔
"Ryan breaths I laugh, he’s so funny and I don’t even know why"
She&#39;s not wrong if sleepy old  joe can become preside then why not the rock 👍
The movie was a little corny in a wholesome way....(god is pissed anyways h come on....we all know what that&#39;s about) and it&#39;s good they are sticking with what they are passionate about bringing into the world we are in
"Way to manspread, Dwayne.."
Churro! gringo...
"Gal sitting lazily, boyishly without a care in the world just doing her thing amazes me. Real badass makes me adore her more."
Green Lantern wonder woman and black adam answering questions on how well they know each other
What does Ryan spend the most money on?<br><br>I would have said “Advertisement for Aviation Gin.”<br><br>How is that gin btw?
"omg ,she is Gorgeous w humor and smile"
I just realized Gal Gadot’s first name is Gal. Her first name is an informal gender pronoun. Don’t mind me. Continue you watching the video.
"wonder woman, Green lantern &amp; Black Adams in 1 place"
Why is DJ manspreading to show his camel toe?
Is everyone calling him DJ now??
Green lantern wonder woman and black Adam together👍 hope to see them together soon in DC
Gadot is Israeli. BDS for life
And I boycott all of their movies
"This, woman is the worst 🤢 🤮"
Watching ryan on this interview is like watching his real characters on his all movie..dont know that he’s actually really funny in real life too!
The woman is so boring omgg
Ryan Renolds.... im afraid of being to high also man😯💨  😌
Those three look so nice 🙂 together.  I really enjoyed the movie 🍿
You guys are hilarious!!!
Cocaine pies for everyone! 😂
"Ryan being surprised he won , but has the only point in the entire video💀"
A my the only one who didn’t understand who DJ was for second?
"THE GOAT 🐐, then theres Dwayne and Gal"
Hi
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=4m40s"">4:40</a> xD That VoiceCrack LMAO"
Ryan’s the 3rd wheel lol
Ryan was right dwts won&#39;t have budget for Dwayne n gal🤣
So funny guys!
Gal Gadot Casting Couch.. you&#39;re welcome
POV they all are DC rayen as green lantern gal as wonder women and rock as black adam
terrified about flying....calls company AVIATION gin.....ok
It&#39;s weird hearing Dwayne Johnson cursing casually lol
I can&#39;t believe no one wrote &quot;blake&quot; as answer to where he spends most of his money...
LMAO &quot;WHAT DOES MAUI MEAN&quot; I&#39;M DEAD!!!
Dwayne has a mangina
Ryan Reynolds is a natural 😂😂
So The Rock goes by DJ?
And all three were in the some Fast and Furious movies. Vin Diesel must be proud of himself.
Red Notice is so fun to watch! I&#39;m hoping for a sequel!!!
My guess for what DJ would have done if he wasn&#39;t an actor (or wrestler) was a Football Player since he was briefly in the Canadian Football League
Dwayne sounds like Barack Obama so he could totally be President
Ryan is great in movie Red Notice
Man I love Ryan but just look at him when Gal&#39;s talking about DJ 😂😂
"When Dwayne asked what he&#39;ll do for a living if he wasn&#39;t an actor, am I the only one that was expecting someone to say wrestling?"
У Галь шутки такие прям отдают совком)) такое у них знакомое послевкусие обычной нашей кривляки
Dwayne is literally so precious
These 3 wonderful people have a truly dynamic chemistry together. The movie &#39;Red Notice&#39; was great! I am really looking forward to the sequel.
Did ya know 2 out of the three are Canadians?
"That leather jacket is screaming, I don&#39;t fit you"
I can&#39;t believe Ryan almost died because he didn&#39;t won&#39;t to use his reserve parachute.
"the questions were difficult af and a bit out there, like guessing the fav song? at least give them a hint."
Hold on!! My fav song too😍😍
😂💕👍
"So now I know why Ryan seems so crazily funny, he had an accident before!!"
Gotta love all three. Such an interesting trio. 🙌👏👏🙌
Is no one going to talk about The Rock&#39;s extreme spreading...? Okay.
I think Ryan reynolds greatest fear is a reoccurring nightmare of being in that terrible green lantern movie again.
"My God, Gal Gadot is one the most beautiful women of all Time. Her face is just Perfection 👌😍"
Does Dwayne ever close his legs 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I bet she loved kissing the rock and the rock loved kissing her hahaha
"I used to love watching these super heroes movies BUT after Gal Gadot publicly support the killing of innocent babies, children, women and men, it totally turned me off. She politicised the killings and using her star power to get support for her evil Zionist group. Therefore, the saying is true… beautiful on the outside BUT so so so… evil in the inside!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=7m43s"">7:43</a> I expect the answer be Aviation Gin or Mint Mobile"
This interview was more entertaining than the movie.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=7m48s"">7:48</a> DJ got that Scooby-Doo laugh"
Such amazing chemistry! I wish they hosted a weekly show together.
"When Deadpool, WW, and Black Adam in Crossover ... LoL"
&quot;hold on&quot; by wilson philips 😂 <br><br>never would have guessed that for a million years... now imagining him singing it... i like &quot;release me&quot; better though... 🤪
The Rock looks like someone put a face on a thumb.
i wonder why gal likes ab workouts so much.....<br><br><br>if you know you know
Ryan is so cool and funny. By the way all three of them look cute together.
what a waste of time that was. VF putting out the top content
"Normally spelling errors bug me a little bit, but there was something really endearing about Gal spelling &quot;Presidant&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m38s"">3:38</a>"
Say No to IDF supporters.
Excellent movie sir ❤️
Gal faces Rayn more than DJ. <br>DJ looks bored.
This was so boring compared to Kevin harts and dj interviews
Is wrestling considered acting? It would have been an easy point
Can anyone else just picture Ryan singing stayin aliveee
I&#39;m laughing on so many levels!!!
Ryan the coolest guy in Hollywood
Them calling Dwayne DJ is the cutest thing to me I don’t know why
Miss Kevin hart in this group
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They are the best
“My toes.. were.. nervous” 😂 idk…
"Trying to figure out who Dj is, I only see the Rock. Shacking my head."
Deadpool is trying to act like Ryan Reynolds too much these days
"Gal kept looking at Ryan. She was almost acting like Dwayne wasn’t even there. Lol! But yeah, she def kept looking to her right, while smiling, playing with her hair and laughing. Lol she def has a thing for him. And yeah she’s married, but we’ve seen these kind of things happen in the industry, over and over again lol"
I just miss kevin hart at this point
What is the new movie?
Ryan and DJ are the Best combo
"Great movie, great cast WE WANT PART 2"
"Watched the film enjoyed it well enjoyed Ryan,DJ For me Gal Gadot is just bland not the best actress"
"A Bad Movie, really bad."
In the way they sit it shows that DJ is the only one with balls of steel
Please do hot ones together!
Since when did the Rock get seedy?
He rock wants to be a poet writer no wonder he loves Taylor Swift songs 😍
They should bring Kevin Hart 😂😂😂
Poner subtitulos en español por favor
Best trio ever!😂🤞🏼❤<br>Hope they make more movies together in the future 😂🔥
"you have Green Lantern , Wonderwoman and Black Adam in the same roof."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> Dwayne: whats makes me always laugh -&gt; Kevin Hart."
Gal has such a beautiful smile.
She’s not going to sing ‘Imagine’ is she in a condescending manner?
Feel like Maxwell while seeing Ryan…
Gal Gadot was SO BAD in this movie wow
Ryan being Deadpool
can I just watch a movie of them answering these questions hahahaha
please shave hairy man
Gal Gadot❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gal Gadot is soooooo pretty
Why she wearing a bin bag 😂
&quot;u make me look like Timothée Chalamet&quot; is a compliment to himself lol
Me:<br>Ryan: SNEAKERS MAN DJ HOW DID NOT YOU GET IT!!!
Ryan sounds gayer and gayer the older he gets.
"Don’t care what anyone says. She is the most beautiful woman in the world. Argue with me if you want. If there is another like her, then it’s a tie. That accent 😍"
Almost halfway into this video and I was like who’s this Dj they keep talking about 🤦‍♀️
Flying ofc y&#39;all forgot Kobe so soon🥲
Cute interview but no interview beats the rock and Kevin hart ! The rock make the remake movie twins and have kevin hart play in it with you!
You&#39;re Welcome
"I added this movie in the worst movies ever list of mine! <br>ridiculous plot, stupid casting and miserable ending!"
"Love you Ryan Reynolds. AKA Deadpool, AKA Green lantern."
DJ: His impression was..<br>Ryan: <i>Terrible</i><br>DJ: <b>Beautiful</b><br><br>Current Showbiz in a nutshell
Hercules Deadpool Wonder woman trio in DCEU would be dope movie
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m40s"">3:40</a> spelt it wrong gal"
LMAOOO
"Deadpool, Wonder Woman and Black Adam….. <br><br>THE ULTIMATE TEAM-UP!!!!!"
I like the way she sits like a boss in them heels and a dress
yeah IIIII MEAN
Ryan Reynolds is just funny without even trying lol
"OMG, are Dwaynes thighs so huge he can’t stop man-spreading, or just needs to air out his balls?"
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m40s"">3:40</a>, Gal doesn&#39;t know the spelling of President😭 she wrote it presidant"
Maybe Gal can make a biopic about what it&#39;s like to be a talentless microcephalic training to kill Palestinians.
After you watch deadpool and listen to ryan just normally talking its so funny
Our Dwayne bhai
"JESUS I know you love me. Please give me the opportunity to love you back , to hug you back , to welcome you back into my heart.                  🏡💜🎈"
Gal.. 😘😘😘😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is stupid. They did just 1 movie and you expect them to know each other well? So they scored zero. That&#39;s how they knew each other well.
Here comes our 10th member
They seem had a lot of Fun.❤️ I love their laughter and bonding...
DJ laughs ❤️
The Rock says..... Hookers and blow. Do you smell what RR is cooking?
Did anyone notice she misspelled &quot;president&quot; ??!

"Every year, every motion picture, real or animated, Dwayne movie just hits box office. This man is movie&#39;s Midas."
The best trio whos heros  we cant ignore
"I need a new phone as just vomited all over it, thanks guys."
The Rock an unproblematic king 👑 🤍
Those three are beautiful people God bless you happy holidays and thanksgiving. Rock is Milton your best friend 😊⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☝️
Weird how such entertaining people can make such a boring movie. 👎
No can match the bond of Kevin and Dwayne Johnson
I heart Bobstone
Wow this dj guy is pretty strong he should be a wrestler
I thought Ryans favourite karaoke song would be &#39;I saw the sign&#39;
Love 💕 this
Comments all about ryan
The movie was a waste of time
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
My go to Song would Be Silhouette of a Pinnacle  RIFF RAFF !!!  Gal Gadot ooo makes my heart melt!
"You guys are all to funny, my goodness,  but Ryan and Dwayne both make me laugh you 2 together are so funny 😆"
Airplane!!! I pity the fool..
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/bCa3w8OWSGM"">https://youtu.be/bCa3w8OWSGM</a>"
They really seem to like each other. That&#39;s great to see.
im a bit disapointed they didnt walk off with one of the statues and the end of the video
top making millionaire  even richer!!!!!
These people seem so on edge like they are afraid to say the wrong thing. I think there biggest fear is being cancelled.
Think they are all winners
Red Notice — the dumbest movie.
Banana 🍌
Movies was wack
I have seen A LOT of movies with DJ in them and i was caught off guard when he said &quot; So fuckin funny&quot;.  I was like.... Have I ever heard him swear before???
ELTON JOHN RULES!!!!!
We could make a drinking game of this video. Every time Ryan says “Wow”...take a shot. 😂
Dwayne Johnson could be the swagiest man alive!!!!! He rules!
how did Dwayne Johnson answer these questions he is as dumb as a rock
My favorite 2 actors and favorite actress!
Good
"Imagine there’s no celebrities, it’s easy if you try… imagine no hunger…"
DJ and Gal: Ryan is a very family man<br>Ryan: SNICKERS
DJ is so awesome great dad...<br>Beautiful family so the sweetest
"I know this is sexist and too manly for the internet, but good god, Gal is forever wife material!"
Shoulda named his daughter Pebbles
why did it take me awhile to realize that &quot;DJ&quot; was the Rock................ I&#39;ve never heard anyone refer to him that way 😭😭
Enjoyed the movie. Probably my 3 favourites in 2021
"If  they could add Kevin Hart in this cast, that&#39;d be perfect!"
Love Dwayne&#39;s comment that the cocaine pie is made by hookers. LOL Can&#39;t wait to see this movie.
He wrote &quot;Air planes&quot; 🤣🤣🤣
Wonder Woman spells it &quot;Presidant of the USA&quot;.
Best actors today..
"A marvel, dc, and a everything charter in a single screen"
Gal Gadot’s face is too large for her head.  Ryan Reynolds is the gayest-voiced straight dude.  The Rock is just the Rock.
🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
The spice girls is clearly Gal’s go to song
Hi Ryan keep going hey Rock keep rocking
I worked with two of these stars ! They really are great people ! I miss you guys keep making us entertained thank you
Don&#39;t worry Ryan I hate flying too
This was fun
If we ever see Gal or DJ on DWStars they ain’t doing good.
ryan funny asf
This was very boring NGL
I guess the takeaway is that they know nothing about each other? Their lack of chemistry is evident in the film too. And they’ll still make their millions. At least Ryan Reynolds is funny.

Gal was like lemme get comfortable here 😂😂😂
Gal 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Gals voice is the exact same one as priyanka chopra
Ryan the third wheel
I don’t like air plane ✈️ either 😬
&quot;Hold on&quot;  is such a good song!!!
Ryan is affraid of airplanes and ironically my dream is to fly once on a plane. Life is unfair.
Get DJ and Gal on dancing with the stars
I&#39;m just gonna say it; Ryan Reynolds held the whole movie😭🙌🏾
Wa la Roca que mal me as caído en esta película estuve apunto de quebrar mi telefono
Ryan really made the movie awesome.<br>I would like to see his all movies if he acted the same movie that he did in Red Notice
Think Ryan and the Rock are getting a bit Overexposed.  But I did actually like them in Red Notice.  The Director did a real good job with this film I thought.
Gal Gadot is one of the most charming personalities in the world ❤
I’d like to see Ryan and Andy Samberg in a movie
I just love Ryan Reynolds
Really funny these 3 ! ♥️
"Jeez, that got deep fast!  Thanks for being super transparent Ryan!"
Gal please for god’s sake stop acting now
"3 of the most formative actors of my young adult life, respected for their contribution to the betterment of others"
Who wants this shite?!
Rayn is still in the character 😂
Such a beauty GAL!
Ryan&#39;s sense of humour is on another level. 😜🤪
&quot;Daddy what does maui mean by hookers and blow&quot; lolllll
She is just annoyingly fake 🙄
"Just put &quot;Kevin hart&quot; and &quot;Ryan Reynolds&quot; in front of each other for a roast , that would be so hilarious 🔥🔥"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m27s"">2:27</a><br>Grammar mistake: You should&#39;ve wrote that down<br>Right grammar: You should&#39;ve written that down"
I would give anything to have the opportunity to simply just hangout with these amazing individuals. Wish I was friends with them...
I died when Gal said president 💀
DJ’s jacket is fabulous. Total movie star type piece of gear. The rest of us probably would be able to pull it off.
The vibes with the 3 of them are amazing. They are good together
Just saw the movie. I loved it but I feel like Ryan carried it lmao he&#39;s hilarious
RR &quot;No one&#39;s competitive here.&quot; ... <br>DJ... &quot;No one.&quot; Got that last word in.<br>😂🤣😂🤣
This movie really sucked big time
Oh!wow uncle freckles 😍
So...they clearly don&#39;t know each other...that&#39;s awkward
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=1m12s"">1:12</a>, they can&#39;t seem to believe Ryan !!"
"If DJ and Gal act in Dancing With The Stars, don&#39;t be surprised if he lifts her in the middle of the dance with only ONE finger."
Gal Gadot is so beautiful it hurts. I wish women were real.

Shoulda had the hot ones guy do it
gwapahang Gal Gadot ui 😍
Just here watching Gal laugh. Such a beauty
Kevin hart must be low-key jealous
Red notice season 2 is coming soon🙃
Blow blew right over Gal&#39;s head.
Took me a while to process that DJ is actually Dwayne Johnson
that movie sucked
Three legends together.
"Ryan has that magnet in every movies he in, it will be laugh magnet"
This interview just felt awkward af.
Ryan Reynolds is my favourite if also yours tell the world here
But they just know each other lol
Perfect Trio
"Wait, Wilson Phillips?!?!!!! YES!!! I love that song!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m 26 (‘95) and yes I know that song thanks to my parents 😂"
its about p
"They have no idea about each other but all of them individually ,are best adorable and anti kevin hart🤣"
"Hey Gal, convince them to sing Imagine with you!"
Dwayne Johnson is an anti American pos
So deadpool/green lantern black atom and Wonder Woman
This movie was terrible.
Ngl ryan looks amazing they need to give him another sexiest man alive title again
Deadpool _ Wonder Women _ Black Adam
Gal Godot so wants to rock djs world.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=8m57s"">8:57</a> Vasectomies  Lmao"
The Rock is a monster with a kind and sweet heat
Daddy what does Maui mean by hookers and blow
if dwayne wouldnt be acting then he would be great rapper along side tech nyne XD
margot would have been better with these two
Rayan is after 💸 💰 that&#39;s why he keeps working on silly scripts.
"Oh.. GL, WW and BA."
i only watched this for ryan reynolds
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m39s"">3:39</a> “Presidant” lmfao Gal Gadot is dumb"
Gal is gorgeous 😍❤️🔥
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/Kj_bLr0_1TM"">https://youtu.be/Kj_bLr0_1TM</a>"
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/IFSpcsAc2NA"">https://youtu.be/IFSpcsAc2NA</a>"
"What&#39;s your favorite workout?<br>&quot;Abdominal workout&quot; - Gal<br>&quot;Really?! Wow, never done one of those&quot; - Ryan<br>Bruh, we saw the gym pics of you training for this movie🤣<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=6m05s"">6:05</a>"
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/IFSpcsAc2NA"">https://youtu.be/IFSpcsAc2NA</a>"
"Ryan sitting with legs crossed, hold on, let me think about that ...."
Is there anything DJ can&#39;t do..he evn writes Haiku  poems..
Red Notice is a trash movie
"Cast members Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds have all played movie super-hero title-roles in the DC Comics universe. The characters they&#39;ve played are the characters Black Adam, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern respectively. Reynolds has also played the Marvel Comics character Deadpool."
I wish that dwayne and ryan were in fast &amp; the furious together
deadpool is ryann
Pie gets mentioned and Rock gets all silent pretty quick.
Ryan makes Dj laugh the most. Sad Kevin Hart noises.
I love these 3 together. Such good personalities ❤️
Gal is so breathtakingly beautiful
gr8 chem...need more!!!
✨DOOOOWWNNNTOOWNN✨
"I still have to watch RED NOTICE but it&#39;s my sincere wish that these 3 have a better on-screen chemistry in the movie in comparison to this painful <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=9m31s"">9:31</a> minutes of forced laughter. Individually, they all look great though!"
its a bollywood movie story with hollywood actors
The point us they don&#39;t know each other...
Even DJ cannot steal the thunder of the mighty Deadpool
Movie sucked.
"A French, An Israeli and an American walk into a museum.."
"Oh my god you where right, it was Jurassic Park"
I remember Ryan telling that parachute story on top gear.
What is dwayne johnsons max bench? I am doing  paper on him for speech and i was going to include something bout his max lift but couldn&#39;t find a definite answer
"Ryan, if you want your movies to sell well, dont partner with sellout dwane"
It&#39;s about drive
"THATS IT, Dwayne Johnson 2024!"
Wait Ryan is a sneakerhead
What was the point of writing the answers down and wasting paper for no reason??
It was an awful movie.
Wish ff12
Gal Gadot MILFFFFFFFF ALL DAY
The way the Rock is looking at gal though
Your welcome
"never thought i would see wonder woman, deadpool and some big bald guy be in the same room"
"DJ: If I wasn&#39;t an actor, what would I do for a living?<br><br>A wrestler!"
I was thinking shoes
I would pay money just to watch the three of them keep talking. Amazing energy they have ❤️❤️
DJ..?
Gal is amazing
DJ for POTUS? I&#39;d vote for him. His positivity would sweep the nation.
ชอบเรื่องนี้ มากๆ และชอบทั้ง 3 คนเลย ติดตามภาคต่อครับ
No chemistry
do they know eachoter ?
"Poor Ryan, did we all just witness him being pushed into the &quot;friend zone&quot;. 😂"
Why do they keep calling him DJ? He is trying to rebrand himself? It is not working.
They don’t know each other at all 🤣
DISLIKE
"Could you find me any better trio to pull a stunt and fun show at the same time? Ryan, Gal and Dwayne, super best!"
Please explain why did ryan compare himself to Timothee Chalamet ?
״חס וחלילה טפו טפו טפו״<br>הלפפפ
Great show . that was awesome
"Can’t believe Ryan Reynolds, The Rock, and that other lady did an interview together"
i love how ryan only won bc he was the only one that got a a point
Lol! Just about to teach haikus to my second graders! DJ...come write one for us?? :)
Ryan&#39;s humor.. 🤭
Yikes! Too much info
Interesting to see. All of them are great and i love them. But u see that the humour between ryan and dj is not so compatible like between dj and kevin h. for example
Great energy between these actors and the movie was good!
"Gal Gadot praising DJ dancing skills while DJ saying, &quot;because I got such a good partner&quot; is the way how you treat a woman. Learn this up boiz"
Part 2
Why have I just realised they were all in fast and furious 😳
Dwayne and Gal looking like the cool siblings and than theres Ryan 😂
Gal Gadot is just ridiculously gorgeous and sweet. I wonder what it&#39;s like to actually look like that?!?!?
"Money is an issue that everyone has for a better and luxurious life. life was hard for me until I started Bitcoin and I&#39;m now earning $9,500 per week."
The Rock is a rock.  Duhhhh.
Gal is soo beautiful 😻
Being afraid of airplanes but also has a gin called Aviators
Please stop taking the Lord&#39;s name in vain.
Ryan won with 1 point.
"One of the most beautiful faces and smiles,  I mean Gal."
I am also scared to death of airplanes
Gal Gadot is actually speaking the same she was in the movie. I thought she was acting 🤔
Best movie ever on Netflix THE ROCK 🤘 is my favourite
Ryan&#39;s fear of airplanes is prolly why Will Ferrel and Ryan swapped for the Jimmy&#39;s.
Ryan Reynolds Can Also Make A Ghost Laugh.😄
Wao waooooo wao.😂
Three amazing artists right here! So funny!
This is literally a real life cards against humanity 😂😂
"Green lantern, Wonder woman and black Adam what a wonderful team"
you know ryan renolds and the rock are legends when they made me watch a full movie with Gal Gadot&#39;s terrible acting
Lets go ryan
Ryan is not that funny why everyone loves him
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=7m33s"">7:33</a> what did they say here?"
PRESIDENT*<b>*</b>
I got the dance scene question right !!😂
Hookers &amp; Blow 🤣🤣
V
"I was confused on the question and answers on what makes Dwayne laugh, you guys cut that part. You can tell there&#39;s bad chemistry between this trio lol."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m55s"">0:55</a> Love it! עם ישראל חי ✡💪"
"Ever since ryan reynolds came out as deadpool, his comedic acting became so much more better and popular"
Their chemistry in the movie was everything 😍
Gal is really crushing on DJ 👀
<b>Was I the only one who got the movie references in Red Notice?</b> I kept asking my bf if he knew/watched the movies they were in and if he understood them.
The movie  red  notice is  absolutely  amazing movie
Presidant?
חס וחלילה טפו טפו טפו לא אני מתה עליה
Thought there be a Canadian question for Ryan lol
Toads...
"Hot Take:  I feel like Ryan is funnier in real life than he is in his movies these days. I guess in these interviews, the comedy just seems to come more naturally and within the moment rather than sometimes feeling forced, scripted (obviously), or trying too hard in films. Just look at how many times he made Gal and DJ laugh in this video. Lol, he was hilarious"
Just promotion promotion guys.... No chemistry
"<b>Crypto investment is the only way to make massive income!!, Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you&#39;ll be ecstatic with the decision you made today</b>"
Gal is the sexiest Woman in Hollywood
"The look that DJ did <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m40s"">2:40</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m41s"">2:41</a> It made me die laughing, you could tell he was embarrassed by what Gal Gadot said"
Gal can hardly look at Dwayne.  All eyes for Ryan.
"Wonder woman, black Adam and Greenland/Deadpool three amazing actors. Also fun fact all of them has 3 daughters each."
Gal is Aphrodite incarnate 🧡💙
Gal Gadot you are one of the most talented beautiful actress I had seen. Love yr acting.
I like the rock and all but I think we&#39;ve had enough democrats in there for a little while screwing things up For this country
I just love Ryan he’s the funniest and one of the best
The rock looked like vin diesel in this video
Gal is such a beauty and what a smile...Ryan and Dwayne are alright.
Thank god Ryan doesn’t own any businesses that might constantly remind him of his distaste for flying.
HAHAHAAH I couldn&#39;t believed DJ would say hookers (even it was a joke) hahahha it&#39;s so funny! 🤣
"I don&#39;t understand how Ryan is so funny, the guy literally cracks me up every time, such a likeable person."
Nice movie i want next part plz
"Gal you are such an inspiration to me 🥰 I love you 😗 and Ryan...so freakin funny and The Rock, you are one of my heros as far as having moral and value and wholesome movies, your wife is beautiful ❤️<br>I can&#39;t wait to see this new movie 🎥🍿🎥"
don&#39;t tell me that i&#39;m the only one who&#39;s only looking at GAL.
Ryan😍😍🤣🤣
Ryan: What is my biggest Fear? <br>Gal: Vanity Fair.
גלל
👍
The ROCK is a SATANIC JOKE whoever works with him must WORSHIP Lucifer as well !!!!! JESUS RULES BAN THE rock
alta peli de mierda que quere que te diga
Red Notice is amazing
This film was suprisingly good
"This was the weirdest duo but the BEST one too for all 3 actors. I was shocked to see these 3 staring in the same movie that I gave it a shot and watched the whole thing which ended with a, &quot;Now that&#39;s a GOOD ending&quot; at the very end. I am looking forward to a part 2, 3, 4, 5!!!!"
"Ryan, Gal and Dwayn. The combination I didn’t know I wanted, but I’m glad exists. They’re just so perfect together."
Hookers and blow.. a part of me feels like I want to believe it..
I thought they are enemies..<br>But they are friend laughing with each other🙄🙄🙄
Watching in mute just to see Gal 😭
Love all them 💝💝💝💝💝💝
The movie wasn’t that great
"A haiku poet?, interesting."
Guy who is scared of airplanes brands his gin &quot;Aviation&quot; haha
He&#39;s same as in the movies😶
"I was afraid of heights, but I worked as a Flight Attendant for 16 years. Just not looking out of the airplane window often. There were worse people who had phobias of flying."
Dam the rock is old af he needs to remain to the pyramid rock
Its a shame most of them worship the devil
Answer correctly all the questions of Gal
Theu just had fun. Totally don&#39;t know each other XD
Incoming need of DJ’s haiku poetry collection
"Ryan doesn’t like airplanes. Men, it’s time to cancel airplanes"
The thing Ryan spends the most money on is Gin and Mobile Networks.
"Black Adam, Wonder Woman, and Deadpool walk into a bar…"
<b>Presidant</b>
Zionist
Did he just say his parachute won’t opened..
i mean... fair play for being apprehensive of heights/planes after all that.
deadpool-wonder woman- the Rock
This interview was a million times better than the movie they&#39;re promoting
Am I the only one who realizes Ryan csn only play himself and that&#39;s not called acting that&#39;s called pretending
&quot;its about drive its about power&quot;
Ryan is sitting so polite n then their is the other 2
Me asking myself why they call the rock &quot;dj&quot; till i realized he is Dwyane Johnson lol
This is a comedy film in itself 🤣
You should have told Dwayne to say I&#39;m The Rock
More liberal thinking people care about what there doing
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m27s"">3:27</a> I will say a bar tender or a personal trainer"
Blake knowing more about the spice girls than the spice girls Blake and Emma Stone would get along. Still waiting for this collab/project
Wheres the Moa Globe?
Ryan: Fears Airplanes.<br>Also Ryan: Owns AVIATION American Gin.
"So they know nothing about each other.  Lol,  I love it!"
The Rocks face when she said Pies!!!🤣
"Ryan is slowly starting to be the best real actor in the world nothing againts the rock but Reynold can act anything, dept, keanu, teh dude doing the witcher and a few others are really good too"
Gal looks so stupid between these two guys!
"Netflix, plz gimme a movie with Gal Gadot &amp; Ana de Armas."
Love them all 😆💗
Ryan is like Saif Ali khan wow and cool
first time watching an interview twice in a row. such a good trio
"אני מתה איך היא אומרת ב <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m55s"">0:55</a> חס וחלילה טפו טפו טפו חחחח כזה ישראלי"
If DJ wasn&#39;t an Actor he should be a Wrestler
I love Gal&#39;s laugh!!! its so infectious
"I don&#39;t know how to explain this but the three of them have the people charm, you just constantly like them😂"
the movie was a bit meh
Oh thats red noticed
"&quot;Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and Black Adam walk into a bar....and Deadpool gets up and says &#39;I thought I killed the Green guy, damnit!!&#39; &quot;"
a couple of uncles 🤣
Тьфу-тьфу-тьфу..
Gal is aging as fine wine 😍
When Ryan is crossing his legs like that I remember Deadpool 2😂😂 when he has baby legs
I so love Gal Gadot 😭❤️✨
What i see..green lantern..wondr women and black adam..hehe
"Good video. If this is one of the important recipes for the progress of the nation : <a href=""https://youtu.be/JSAoqs2JlJE"">https://youtu.be/JSAoqs2JlJE</a>"
Ryan just plays himself in every movie.He has the same personality as all his characters
"I like these 3 actors, the only thing I didn&#39;t like about them is this..... in order for them not to be criticized by the hollywood elites and just like any other hollywood who cares about what others think about them, they all bad mouth President Trump just so they can still be working in the hollywood industry.<br>The three of them were just too scared to be true to their selves, or maybe perhaps they didn&#39;t fall into rank and file, but those are actually their true feelings. Either way, I lost some respect for these 3 actors."
Why dafak is the volume so low.. Ergh
"A good looking Funny guy, a crazily articulate gorgeous woman, and a super fit, gentle Alpha Male. <br><br>These 3 are like the top of their categories."
Ryan Reynolds getting paid for just being himself.
Glad I guessed Gal’s favorite workout 😍
Producer: what&#39;s the movie about?<br><br>The Rock: <b>IT&#39;S ABOUT DRIVE IT&#39;S ABOUT POWER WE STAY HUNGRY WE DEVOUR</b>
Ryan literally tries to buy sneakers in Free Guy
I think it’s bizarre that Ryan has “fans” who can’t even tell this isn’t Ryan?  Come on guys.  Wake up.
Poor deepfakes but good to show people to wake them up to the fact that they’re all gone.
I love DJ and my girl Gal but …. my God all of my heart is for Ryan. I call him the love of my life In front of my boyfriend (I don&#39;t even call my bf that)
Red Notice was soooo good! I really hope there&#39;s a second movie in y&#39;alls future because I&#39;d love to see this trio together again! :)
"I finally saw a Dwayne and Ryan Reynolds action movie, it was amazing really enjoyed it. Also loved the Ed Sheeran camo 😂"
Legends 🙌
Dwayne the adrenochrome isn&#39;t doing your face any justice. Looks like you aged 30 years since your last flick. Perhaps you should switch to reefer.
Ahhhh <br>Gal so so pretty
I love her Hebrew! What a queen!
All of their favorite things is making a gal sandwich with the three of them
"Lol Wilson Phillips, I laughed so hard at that 😂😂😂"
"He is clearly exhibiting a low Reynolds number in this video, very clear laminar flow."
gal is soooooo fine bro i cant
There&#39;s pretty much zero chemistry between any of them both here and in the movie.
Ryan is so funny 😂
How is Ryan legs crossed that tight? Doesn&#39;t he have any balls🤣🤣🤣

"<a href=""https://youtu.be/YoNNdxVj2qE"">https://youtu.be/YoNNdxVj2qE</a>"
Deadpool wearing the Ryan Reynolds suit
The Rock man spreading big time  giving off those alpha vibes
"Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Black Adam 🤗"
Gal is so fine
Dj lol
Talking about no chemestry
Perfect triplet to be in a movie together
They made the lights so bright that not only can you not see the card text but DJ looks white lol
"Deadpool, Gisele, and Hobbs."
I think we all know Ryan&#39;s song is &quot;I Swear&quot; by All-4-One
"Dwayne Johnson, is  a great example of a Human being! The man has done so much to help the less fortunate. And I can tell you that I don&#39;t much care for most people, as I am just an old bitter Veteran living in his old car. But, Dwayne Johnson is the reason I don&#39;t give up completely. Just knowing all He has done to help the poor &amp; Homeless."
Where did every last one of them are in the either the dcmu or the marvel mu all of them are superheroes and it literally hanging out like they&#39;re the Justice League LOL 😂👌💯
His mind must be racing every single second
“Pumpkin butter salesman” hahahahaha! 🤣
"Lost me at Gal Gadot and the fact that everyone is so chummy with her when she publicly supports geocide. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23freepalestine"">#FreePalestine</a>"
"Literally just watched the movie and it was amazing, also I just realized u can call Dwane Johnson.... simply DJ 😂🤦🏼‍♀️"
They literally don&#39;t know eachother
"Ryan is just incredible, the Rock is amazing, and Gal is extremely overrated as usual. Let&#39;s just throw in a token model that can&#39;t act to be progressive."
can&#39;t wait for RN 2
I wish I could be gals gadot toilet for a day
But seriously - gal gadot is the only name I&#39;ve heard of.  Isn&#39;t she an actress or something?
Red notice the most boring movie of the year. For the first time in my life I got so bored of a movie that I stop watching. the script is so predictable that even this so strong cast isn&#39;t enough to save it
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=8m21s"">8:21</a> lol"
Lame
"Too bad giselle in FF is dead. If giselle somehow still alive, we could see 3 of them together again in FF spin off."
Saw the movie this morning. Was not expecting that plot twist
Takeaway: bake one very special pie
Gal is the worst actress in Hollywood 👎👎👎 she&#39;s awful in acting
Whats a criminals favorite shoe? Sneakers. Lol
Manspreading is DJs signature
I was so confused when I thought Dwayne had said lick instead of nic at the beginning 😳
"Why would ryan say that about Tim, Tim is such an amazing man 😭😭😭😭😂"
pop culture trash
You can tell they all have good positive energy. Love it!
Great movie. Loved that Ryan was drinking his Aviation Gin in it! I was then waiting for his cell phone to be on a Mint mobile plan.
Am I the only one seeing Wade Wilson?
Deadpoolxwonderwomanxblackadam
My all time fave! RYAN!!!!
Qhh..gal and Dwayne touch echother
Ryan reynold is so underrated.
I always confused is ryan on character dialogue or not 🤣🤣.. On and Off film set he always the same funny
The rock for president!!
Cool guys together….
gal is so cute
Epic
Epic
I said football for DJ’s profession if he wasn’t an actor
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m52s"">2:52</a>  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m03s"">3:03</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m13s"">3:13</a> such a humble guy for real!!!"
I guessed the dancing scene o_0
Great Cast
Repent to Jesus Christ!<br>“Blessed are those who keep his statutes and seek him with all their heart—”<br>‭‭Psalms‬ ‭119:2‬ ‭NIV‬‬<br>B
“She likes To throw that Squad rack on her back and get 400 pounds on........ OR ZUMBA?” 😂😂😂😂😂
Deadpool<br>Wonderwoman<br>Black Adam how awesome
deadpool + wonderwoman + black adam
Oh my lord gal gadot beauty is just hypnotizing
Made by hookers 😂😂😂
Ryans 3 uncles: Which 2 of us??
❤️❤️❤️ Love their chemistry!!  Who knew Green Lantern was afraid of flying?  Never would have ever guessed. ❤️❤️❤️
I love this movieeeeee
What would DJ do if not an actor...Wrestler?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=1m33s"">1:33</a> even the way she gasp is too adorable lol"
"One of the most stupid movies, predictable with no sense, lack of originality. Just the actors, but still so far…"
I would have guessed that the thing Ryan spends the most money on is engagement rings.
Her smile is so pretty bro
Do people actually care about this nonsense. I see no purpose to this pointless video.
Omg my Wilson Phillips spirit animal!! 😍😭
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23therockforpresident2024"">#therockforpresident2024</a> 🗣🗣🗣"
I just love them
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Ryan... Fear of flying? You named your Gin AVIATOR!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyWDyqFqPHs"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyWDyqFqPHs</a>"
Not the rock man spreading this whole video
Dwayne definitely tapped that
They need to make more movies together!!!!
Gal&#39;s sitting position gives me comfort. I love the way she slouches and moves her legs apart. Most actresses and models sit with their legs crossed for a long time and I always thought I was not &#39;lady like&#39; coz I can&#39;t do it. Seeing Gal sit that way makes me feel good
GAL GADOT RUINS THE WHOLE MOVIE
the timothée thing didn’t sit right with me but i’m prolly just trippin LMAO
I just love how Ryan sits the same as Gal. Such a legend.
Gal ga hot
What most people don&#39;t know is that Dwayne is crushing an invisible column between his legs and that&#39;s why he manspreads like that.
I think gal gadot is the only bad thing in the movie
"I was like, “Who is DJ?” :))"
"Ryan plays himself in every movie he stars in.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>There are some exceptions,obviously..."
"&quot;I highly doubt you&#39;re in their budget,&quot; that laugh was too big because it was real lol"
Timothée Chalamet about to go wild knowing Ryan Reynolds just named bombed him xD
I’m just- WOW! Netflix never could have found a better cast then this one!
Ryan literally plays himself in most movies he’s just quirky like that so fun to watch
"Why does Dwayne always have great chemistry with his co stars. Always seems like best friends when he does interviews with them, must be a great guy"
Ryan is the coolest guy in Hollywood
"I just wanted a group-hug, they wibe so good togheter!"
"GREEN LANTERN. WONDER <a href=""http://woman.black/"">WOMAN.BLACK</a> ADAM"
Ryan: &quot;sneakers would be my biggest expense&quot;. Also the same guy who has just bought Wrexham football club. 😂
Netflix where are those bloopers
Three actors who would never win Oscar!!!!
"Whatever happened to watching your language around a lady? Sorry mate but if you used that language around my wife or kids, I don&#39;t care how big you are or your ego is I will put you in your place."
gal&#39;s laugh gets me every time
This is a good example where a question or two should have been scripted and thrown in... just sayin.
"Red Notice is basically: <b>Black Adam, Wonder Woman and Deadpool on vacation</b>"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m18s"">3:18</a> ryan &quot;I highly doubt you are in their (dancing with the stars) budget&quot; 🤣🤣🤣"
"Black Adam, green Lantern and wonder woman😊😊"
"Matthew 6:6<br>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.<br><br>Mark 7:29<br>And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.<br><br>Mark 10:12<br>And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery."
Mummy what’s a Cocaine?
Gal is so hot.
Is that parachute story true?  Is that why he wrote that scene in DP2 where X-Force is wiped out skydiving?
Dwanye looks dripy
I love Gal!! She thinks Abbs is a type of workout 😂
"Where Ryan Reynolds is there, entertainment is there!"
Why don&#39;t you dance for charity and make a show of it.
"Ryan, Gal and Dwayn. The combination I didn’t know I wanted, but I’m glad exists. They’re just so perfect together."
Rock being a third wheel
1 up
was expecting kevin hart to make a guest appearance or something 😅
three talentless players together ...
1 up
"Cant watch this movie cuz of the rock, hes so annoying"
"Time like this,i always missed the rock and kevin hart interview"
"I see Green lantern, Wonder Woman and black Adam here"
"I suppose it gets tiring when they have to do a whole load of these one after the other (which is why Mila Kunis enjoyed this interview so much - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4Ezruu1oeQ)"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4Ezruu1oeQ)</a><br><br>But of course Gal still looks absolutely stunning."
חחחחחחחחח כשהיא אמרה טפו טפו טפו
"Sneakers, especially collecting insane amounts, are a top environment killer.<br>Nike Europe do not even take back returns, hundreds, or maybe even thousands, of brand new pairs get shredded each day in Belgium."
I din know we can call him DJ!!
Please the video Motivational speech of WILL SMITH:                                                                                                                                                                        WILL SMITH MOTIVATION SPEECH ON HOW TO FAIL FORWARD ! - YouTube
Lucefarian Elites
Spice girls are the BEST!
Crap movie :/
this trio should do another movie together
I think the new name for Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson be &quot;Fruity Pebble&quot;. Especially with his most recent virtue signalling and pandering in regards to Alec Bladwin killing someone with a gun.
Cool movie
dj
The cast was the only good thing of this movie..
Dude have a gin called Aviation! WTH Ryan!
These 3 would be a blast to hang out with
Ryan Reynolds is a god.
👍👍👍
I never heard someone calling Dwayne DJ omg 😭
This 3 fit so smoothly man.
Gal seems so cool to bad she isn&#39;t single
"אין על גל בעולם, &quot;חמסה טפו טפו טפו&quot;"
"If gal wasn&#39;t an actor, she&#39;d still be terrorizing Palestinian kids... Just saying!"
there needs to be a second movie!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=7m40s"">7:40</a> i say he spends his most money on gin."
ryan and adam sandler are the coolest actor on the planet when it comes to humour
Just have all these tone deaf idiot sing imagine again. . . Eff these commies.
חס וחלילה חחחחחח
Daddy what does mauvi means by hookers and blow?
Ryan is just a great guy.
This is a awesome group of people
Love you guys
"Dwayne : brave and muscular  (best in jumanji)<br>Ryan : the funny guy (best in deadpool)<br>Gal : h<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23t"">#t</a>  (best in RED NOTICE)"
Sp basically they don&#39;t know each other very well. But they have a lot of fun though!
Gal can you do a Chanel were you can Teach or Tell US why and HoW you are so good at fighting 🥺🥰
"JESUS IS LORD AND KINGS OF KINGS <br><br>Jesus loves you He die for you and arose to give you life. And still loves you even though you reject him.

"gal sits more manly than ryan, i love it!"
Gal Gadot Her se*uctive Voice man 🔥🤩😘
"Good cast, bad movie."
"So Wonder Woman, Black Adam and Green Lantern walk into a bar....."
WHERE did Gal get those pants? They look insanely comfy.
make them customers of your mint mobile
Why i always imagine Ryan is a deadpool...
"I don’t know why people make this women Gal so famous, she has a body of a man and a face  of Zionism, is it because of just that she’s famous??!!"
"Just because of the spice girls thing, i am going to rewatch deadpool"
That&#39;s a lot of famous people together
Hi Deadpool 🥺🥺🥺
Gal gadot so hot
At this point i dont distinguish if ryan is acting or being himself all the time
"Doesn&#39;t like airplanes, owns a Gin company called Aviation."
Same actors doing the same films using the same boring acting
What would DJ do if he wasn&#39;t an actor and nobody said wrestler? Wow.
Woooow
"Deadpool, wonder woman, black Adam."
Is it just me or you’re also hearing for the first time people calling The rock- “DJ”? 🤷‍♀️😳
Bruhhh sorry I was like who tf is DJ? 😃
I can&#39;t believe Netflix paid Gal 20 MIllion for this movie🙄. She&#39;s good but not worth 20M like Reynolds or the Rock. This gender pay this ridiculous
Why are they calling him DJ? He&#39;s the Rock. The world knows him as the Rock.
They don’t..
So in other words they don’t know each other at all
President Dwayne Johnson
Berg hasn&#39;t aged a day!
"“What would I be if I wasn’t an actor”<br><br>Umm, you’d be a professional wrestler"
I love dwayne..
Ryan&#39;s legs:\|<br>Gal&#39;s legs:/|<br>Rock&#39;s legs:/       \
"Three observations:<br>Ryan-Afraid of airplanes,  sponsored by Aviation Gin.   <br>Dwayne-Has no genitals in those pants<br>Gal- Has a thing or had a fling, with Dwayne, and aint hiding it."
Am I the only one who&#39;s wondering what happened with DJ and Kevin Hart? Seems like they&#39;re not as close anymore or something
"Gal flirting with &quot;DJ&quot; for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=9m30s"">9:30</a> minutes straight - and DJ calling her &quot;such a good friend&quot;. Classic."
Great casting but the movie was baaaaaad!
Boring interview
It&#39;s so interesting to hear their voices on the show and not in the movie

Why does Dwayne Johnson sit there with his legs wide open? It&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything there!
I swear Gal Gadot looks so much beautiful I don’t know how to explain in words 🥺😭<br><br>Y’all agree with me ? 😅🤭
HAS ANYONE NOTICED!!! THESE THREE GUYS ARE SUPER HEROES!!!!!!🤯😱
part 2 for R.N please..Great Movie...Great Actor&#39;s and Actress ❤️
This really very cool and fun game
Ryan is afraid of airplanes but decided to brand his Gin &#39;Aviation Gin&#39;?
"One of the worst movies ive ever seen, too many twists and a silly story"
I love Gal one of the most beautiful actress in Holywood.
DJ should have got points for pilates. It&#39;s all in the abs and GG loves it.
"Based on my perspective, it appears that Gal and Dwayne have feelings for each other."
Cool interview
I think he dose spend lots of money on hookers.
Reynolds Always Create the different fan base! You are cool guy🙈❤️
Another generic movie of Dwayne Johnson.
"the rock would be a wrestler, of course, how did nobody think of that?"
The amazing actors trio of Red Notice!
It&#39;s interesting how they only acted a movie together and they make very close to correct guesses about each other.
Wow that was so boring I thought for sure this would be a great video.  Lol
💗💗💘💘💘💗💗💗💗💘💘💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖Gal Gadot
"I think the only time I wasn&#39;t looking at the beautiful woman in the middle, was when they actually zoomed in on the other people. which I barely noticed!"
So much love to Gal Gadot
"Thats just deadpool cosplaying Rayn &#39;,&#39;"
Yeahhhh big fan of Gal Gadot
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m56s"">0:56</a> made me interested in this actress))) does she know Russian?"
3 people who are COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS to what the real world is.
Why does the rock not look brown?
הישראליות פשוט זלגה מגל 😆
awful movie
Why do i only hear deadpool when he speaks? 😂😂
Ryan is the bestest
"Gsl is so gorgeous...I looove her...<br>But she took my last fry,dammit"
Галь сделала тьфу тьфу тьфу? Или мне показалось?
If I&#39;m in a conversation with Ryan Reynolds I&#39;m gonna cry laughing.
They looks so fun to be with lol
"Gal could hardly take her eyes off our boy, Ryan... 😍<br>Something is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23brewing"">#brewing</a> up here..."
In red notice it&#39;s just a not 18+ version of Deadpool but it&#39;s is him
this video is more entertaining than entire red notice movie
Maybe Dwayne should cross his legs. 🤭
My mom&#39;s favourite is Hold on 😍too
the charisma in this video is off the charts
What a interesting trio
Bring Ryan and RDJr. together 😂
I really felt that they deserve to have crossover in thier superhero movie. Or Part 2 again hopefully
None of them knows the rock man. I bet Dwayne is missing Kevin hard

Spice girls!!!!!
Deadpool | Wonder woman | Black Adam
Didn&#39;t Ryan throw out spice girls in the movie &quot;9 underground&quot;
"Wow, who ever thought a Demigod and an Immortal Vigilante would get along so well"
"Big fan, you guys are amazing ❤❤❤"
"Who are they,.. most be some Hollywood thing,. If they made good movies BUT"
"He said snickers and I thought he meant chocolates, that he ate lots of chocolates 🤣🤣"
Gal got boring questions!
Red Notice was probably one of the top three worst movies I&#39;ve ever watched. What a time waster.
RR fan since National Lampoon Van Wilder
Is it me or Gal wants the tip of the iceb…rock?
Watched the movie . Awesome
<b>Ryan</b>
Dafuq is &quot;Red Notice&quot;
I love how she said “Chas vchalila”
"Hahaha, what I love about Ryan Reynolds is that when he plays in movies he’s basically just being himself. Playing a thief? But Ryan’s humor/personality still shines through ✨"
"Gal Gadot, I can&#39;t believe how marvellous she is"
We need Red Notice 2
Im very simple person i see gal gadot i unwatched and dislike
Gal used to be part of an army that murders children. Nice choice VF
Rock the goat
I&#39;ve known since January 2021 about the New Indiana Jones movie. <br>Ironically Red Notice is an easter egg.
"Deadpool, Wonder Woman, and Black Adam."
"Deadpool , wonder woman and black Adam in one picture."
"my best action star is Tom Cruise(fighting, motorcycle, plane, helicopter, sky diving, diving, etc, and Jacky Chan (kung fu, climbing, jumping on risky heights, fighting equipments) , they bring the movie to reality coz they themself Do the stunts, this three depend on stunts"
I think Ryan should make fun out of DC with them
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=1m58s"">1:58</a> same  thing happened to dicaprio too ..."
Kinda ironic that I lost my parents to a plane crash
Rayan everytime beside Dwayne is a pretty humble guy
Now everyone is going to send Ryan mystery pies daily now that we know 😂😂
"This is a haiku<br>Five syllables, then seven<br>And then five again"
these three people filmed a whole movie together and they don&#39;t know a single thing about eachother
I watched this whole thing without realizing the “DJ” they were talking about was Dwayne Johnson 😂😂😭
They have better chemistry here then they did in the movie. (Not to say they were bad in the movie)
Love u all three guys ❤️
Dwayne chain is funny.
Till now Ryan still showing his Deadpool vibe.
im sorry but when he said like butter all i could think was <b>SMOOTH LIKE BUTTER</b>
Like butter
didn’t know Dwayne Johnson nickname was DJ nice
FREE PALESTINE.
"i predicted that if Dwyan wasn&#39;t an actor, he would be something completely unexpected, and i was right."
the pilot in the movie is scared of airplanes 😂lol
Gal Gadot’s accent so weird
President or General lmao that dude does not need to be anywhere near government or military
Hi Ryan and Dwayne - Free Palestine! 🇵🇸
"If Dwayne Johnson was not an actor he would be?<br>Me: Um, a Wrestler?"
zZZZZzz
Red notice......
"Ryan, DJ., mikes epps, an Kat Williams in a comedy movies"
Kevin hart would have killled rock here😂😂
I am amazed how deadpool could fit in between wonder woman and black adam..
Gal gadot sitting comfortably&gt;&gt;&gt;
Why you gotta go using my name Mr Rock...
Bro how tf cud ryan be so funny
I wanna see the uncut version with Ryan&#39;s impressions lmaoo
Did dwayne said that he is Brock Lesnar?
Ryan&#39;s answer for what he spends most money on should have been Mint Mobile.
They were so cute and loving 🥰 together 🙏🏻👍❤️
All those fake laugher
Gal is so fine
"ther coolest guy is Keanu reeves, funniest to hang out with would be ryan renolds, DJ is one guy you can depend on to have companion on your travels."
Gal gadot is unreal
What a trio of beautiful people. Comm&#39;on
"1,440,176 views, 38k likes, 440 dislikes, 1.1k comments, 3.41M subscribers. Nice!!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m54s"">2:54</a> DJ&#39;s a big guy<br><br><b>wait hold up</b>"
"Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Black Adam. What a movie! Lol"
If dj wasn&#39;t an actor he&#39;d be an nfl player or professional wrestler 🤔
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=5m36s"">5:36</a> I was really hoping Ryan was gonna say The Rock’s verse in Face off 😂"
I didn&#39;t know the rock was white
🤣💜🤣💜🤣💜
"My insincere comment: Very expensive people, poor Netflix.<br><br>My honest/sincere comment: Man, you guys are the best!"
"The storyline was awful. Just really bad. I don&#39;t think the character suited Reynolds, Gadot was awful. The big guy, well just the usual predictable. Generic, waste of time."
even leather stretches around the rocks muscles
Loved the movie! Really enjoyed it.
"Wonder Woman , Black Adam , &amp; Deadpool just answering some questions."
I’m thinking DJ is a little intimidated. Love the blow ref
Ryan saying WOW is so satisfying
All three of them have three daughters 🥺🤩
Couple of uncles 😭
Chemistry is off the charts 3 very great actors I love it!!
Gal can’t take her eyes off with ryan
The way Gal is looking and laughing at Ryan everytime...
Spice Girls Forever!
"That poor leather jacket of the rock, I can hear her scream for help"
I wonder if Ryan Reignalds fear of airplanes had anything to do with the parachuting accident in Deadpool 2.
A reminder the God loves you and Jesus died for your sins 💓💓
"ngl, for me, i love ryan reynold&#39;s acting, he did a great job and he literally carried the show &lt;333"
I was today years old when I found out that people call Dwayne Johnson &quot;DJ&quot; 🤯
Just watched the  movie.  Loved it. These guys seem fun.
Red notice sucks
Gal Gadot is a waste of movie space. Please stop casting her.
For some reason I have no problem imagining the rock as a ballerina
ZERO chemistry!!
This is the first I&#39;ve seen Dwayne referred to as DJ. That&#39;s going to be some time to get used to.
"They could have those three make a movie about any random plot, and I would watch it multiple times!"
There&#39;s every straight man&#39;s crush and then there&#39;s the rock and gal gadot
Ryan is always in Deadpool character
Im sure she feels like the luckiest girl in the world!!!
"3 of d coolest hollywood stars, love ds cast..seems like ryan &amp; rock competing for most movies made in a year..so much excited to watch, coz u can expect an amazing ride💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥"
Ryan&#39;s greatest fear should be fighting with Gal. 🤣🤣.... Fav stars all the time 🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍💛💛
Ryan is such a comedian
Gal Gadot is adorable
I think the Rock laughs the most when his costars make fun of him. <br>Watch the Central Intelligence movie outtakes
This was truly a lot of fun to watch I wish they had more videos like this
"they are trying so hard to make gal Godot likeable again after her covid stunt, lol"
They were all so wrong and yet it was still so wholesome
Ryan is so funny
This is a great cast can’t wait to see this movie 🎥
"Airplanes, says the guy who&#39;s a partner in a company named Aviation Gin? Lol come on man! Lol!"
How did DJ resist going back to “The Rock loves pie” when that comes up…
I’m disappointed Ryan didn’t sarcastically asked if he ever considered doing wrestling if acting didn’t workout lol
My goto karaoke song is &quot;Just a Gigalo&quot;. Yours were kind of lame...so I would like to hear RR or DJ sing &quot;Just a Gigalo&quot;.
"Gal Gadot nd Chris Pine have off the charts chemistry, not with these guys....."
"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16. <br>Jesus loves you.<br>If you wish to Surrender your life to Jesus Christ. Please repeat this...My Lord Jesus...I am a sinner...I come to you today... I confess my sins and I repent of them all. Please accept me as your son/daughter....wash me with your blood...I confess you as my Lord and personal saviour ... In Jesus name. Amen<br>Welcome into God&#39;s family!"
"No more The Rock, it&#39;s DJ!"
Nice to see three happily married family people who are movie stars
This movie flopped .😥
I stan a duo of:<br>~DJ and Ryan<br>~DJ and Jason Stapham<br>They really make great onscreen duos♥
They know nothing about each other!
These guys r massive ❣️❣️❣️
"Love how they are so different but click so great! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=7m44s"">7:44</a> their legs! 😂"
Ryan is literally my favorite
You are all great
so thats the deal in free guy he wanted them sneekers so bad
"funny how everyone says oh its Deadpool, Wonder Woman and Black Adam, but people for some reason forget hes Green lantern!"
"Lovely people, they seem sweet."
Chris Pine is jealous 😂
Dj&#39;s spread legs just got me 😂😂<br>They are like east and west
2 of the nicest celebs and a children killer
This movie was soooo bad
The movie was awesome
I never thought I&#39;d get sick of Ryan Reynolds but this whole &quot;we&#39;re all pals and WACKY&quot; thing he has going with the other two is getting really old.
1000th comment
End all famous people
We need a Ryan sneaker collection video
This got me smiling throughout 😂
I love these actors. They are great.❤️🙂
In five years they will say this was one of the worst movies they made..... But for now we all love it. I love it too ;)
Haha I feel like I only watched these three in the movie. I didn&#39;t care about anyone else in it 😂
חחחחח טפו טפו טפו איזה מושלמת
Dwayne with his leg spread 🤦‍♀️
"It seems like these guys really like each other…a lot! Like old buddies, very nice to see."
Was anyone else confused when they kept saying DJ<br>&quot;The rock&quot; turned dj
I was waiting for kevin hart to do a cameo on this movie..
I just watched Red Notice a couple days ago.
Gal is looking and sounding more like &quot;The Nanny&quot; (Fran Drescher) every day...
I love the movie
Spotify Wrapped 2021 in two weeks!
Wonder Woman and Deadpool
"when Dwayne asked what he would do if he was never an actor, who else thought rapper cuz of the: it’s about drive it’s about power 💪💪"
This was a great movie!  Before it was over I said I really hope they make this a franchise!! Excellent casting and story.
חס וחלילה טפו טפו פטו🤣🤣🤣
Watching Gal Gadot try and act is rough.
I LOVE THIS CAST
"Sometimes the chemistry between actors is amazing, and this is one of those cases.<br><br>Other great cases I remember were between Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, and Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal"
Starting to see some age coming to DJ&#39;s face
so they really dont know each other lol
I would&#39;ve thought he spends way too much money on Hugh Jackman pranks
Blake must have a blast next to that guy on the daily
Looking forward for a sequel!!!
"Why do all jackets look so uncomfortable in DJ,"
I love all 3 of these people but Ryan is just so funny! I can’t help but laugh at everything he said in Red Notice!
"i really enjoyed the movie, it was funny af, especially Ryan....sad to see the reviews for the film is mixed though coz that means chances for a hypothetical sequel will be much lower if it didn&#39;t perform well commercially"
"I&#39;m a big fan of fal Gadot, but I found her acting very superficial in this movie. It made me realize she&#39;s not good at acting, but her charisma, beauty, everything else is on another level."
Lmao Ryan is the third wheel<br>In this trip 😂
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱😷
"When gal asked her fav workout, I literally said “probably abs”"
Ryan&#39;s biggest fear is having a face like Deadpool!
these 3 have 0 chemistry in the movie.
Loved it. Great job.
"This movie is typical heist, but still comical and entertaining!"
Ryan&#39;s signature laugh at every dire situation is priceless😂
Gal is so beautiful
Ryan here also playing like his acting
Can you buy a smaller jacket.   Really  you look like a girl in the 90s with that.
Ryan is like this in real life. always acting a fool lol
Guessed right on the abs
the fucks with the sound why is it so quiet
I think this is the 1st time someone calls The Rock &quot;DJ&quot;
"My choice for Best scene in Red Notice? The first prison food scene between Deadpool and Black Adam... that was hilarious!! <br>&quot;Nyet politsiya. Not a cop. This man is not a cop, all right? Get that through your thick skulls right now! He&#39;s a profiler for the FBI... &quot; ha HA HA HA.. Laugh so much...."
"Deadpool, Wonder Woman and Black Adam walk into a bar.... and it was cinematic. ;-)"
Dwayne could definitely go up a size in his clothing 😭
I enjoyed this movie
iv never called freckles DJ before... i like it

"I love you my love, Gal"
this was legit funny. Dj and Ryan are the one of the funniest in Biz
"Daddy ,wat does Maui mean hookers and blow<br>Literally lmao 😂😂😂"
You make me look like timothée chalamet 😂
At least she&#39;s not singing.
"Ryan is just downright hilarious, I swear every word he says can make for a good movie punchline TT___TT"
I don&#39;t know how to be an American actor
“I don’t want to be bob sponge” haha i love her so much but she will never outlive that
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m38s"">3:38</a> Gal &quot;PresidEnt&quot;"
What an ICONIC combo<br><b>Green lantern x Wonder Woman x Black Adams</b> 💥
Gal is so annoying
I want Ryan to kill me.
I feel like DJ is not a good nickname
Dj looking like Vin Diesel
"LOL Gal is so awkward, she&#39;s like the 3rd wheel in this interview. I can only watch and enjoy the part of Ryan and Dwayne go back and forth"
that was great guys!!!

Sneaker shopping with deadpool
Pumpkin butter salesman 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There is how much posiblity of red notice 2
This man is scared of flying but owns AVIATION GIN lmao amazing
Well three you assholes voted for the loser who&#39;s running the country now so you all know each other pretty good
Ryan isn&#39;t acting in his movies. He&#39;s just being himself
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m20s"">3:20</a> True 😂 can&#39;t afford"
Dwayne Johnson looks as white as Bruce Willis these days. Wonder what gives.
We need the Red Notice blooper reel. I&#39;d pay to see it
"Deadpool, Wonder Woman and Black Adam"
Y’all are great together can’t wait to be a actor or the president
The trio I never knew I need in my life. They&#39;re just vibing in here
"Ryan changed comedy! Hes a player on his own field. so unique! Crafty, witty, subtle offensive that sneaks in for a kiss - kinda like indian spicy where its good but later you feel it."
"Co thirsty chase roman 35y, death 89, and chilmur, eng know high, scholar, Univ, hunger tort , un victim, thesis theft."
THese guys just dont know each othe rlol hahaha what a pointless test but fun anyway
im just waited for a movie where Ryan Reynolds doesnt play the same character as always
Hey gal gadot (DOWN..DOWN..YOU KNOW I LIKE TO GO DOWNTOWN...DOWN..DOWN..WAITING TO GO DOWNTOWN) LMAO!!!😜😛
DJ Is sucha sweetest Human
Deadpool and Black Adam&#39;s mutual friend Wonder Woman
Wrexham FC should have been the answer for what Ryan spends that most money on
Ryan Reynolds never disappoints man warra guy
I loved both then ... so funny n the movie was amazing... tks 🥰🥰🥰
can&#39;t wait for the sequel&lt;3
Ryan and RDJ would be hilarious
Ryan Reynolds and Nolan Booth are literally the same
I totally pulled out my butt Gal&#39;s Dancing scene and abs workout. That is sooo random LOL!!
RYAN REYNOLDS HUHU
"Gal, where&#39;s BOI?"
Gal 😍🤭
This is the first time my eyes weren’t fixated on Gal Gadot the whole time. Ryan Reynolds has my heart.
"Never watching any of Gals movies again.. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23idfsoldier"">#IDFsoldier</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23doulestandards"">#DouleStandards</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23childabuser"">#ChildAbuser</a>"
Great movie! The rock is a pretty charismatic guy but it doesn&#39;t seem like it too much when Ryan is around...also I loved how in the movie ryan is drinking aviation gin and the rock is drinking teremana tequila that was great!
🤞🤞
Gal Gadot is a queen 😍 these 3 are brilliant.
Hi
🏃🏃🏃🏋🏿‍♂️🏋🏿‍♂️🏋🏿‍♂️❤️❤️❤️🌠🌠🏃🏃⛵⛵🏃🏋🏿‍♂️⛵⛵🌏🌍🌍🕺🙏🏾🏃🙏🏾
"BEST RYAN REYNOLDS LINE EVER..<br>,&quot;DONT PULL UR RESERVE OR YOU&#39;LL HAVE NO CHUTE LEFT&quot;. HAHAHAH DEADPOOL GENUIS 😆"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m40s"">3:40</a> Gal wrote &#39;Presidant of U.S.A&#39; and smiles like a proud mama bear🙂<br><br><br>NICE! (Hear it in Michael Rosen&#39;s voice)"
Shame Gadot is a terrible actor and the chemistry was non existent in this movie.
WE&#39;RE WAITING FOR NETFLIX&#39;S TIME AND MONEY!
I HIGHLY DOUBT YOUR IN THEIR BUDGET!
THIS IS THE PERFECT TRIO!
RYAN BASICALLY PLAYS HIMSELF IN EVERY MOVIE HE&#39;S IN!
Extremely predictable movie.
I like this trio 👍
Ryan afraid of plains but has Aviation gin.
I seriously want to see Ryan’s sneaker collection now that he mentioned it… make it happen VANITY!! 🥰
"Ryan is right, we rely too much on man made stuff."
AWESOME 🤩 ALL Three🤩🥰
"great trio, very fun, they made the funniest movies in recent times,i just love the way the industry is going now, hitmans bodyguard ,deadpoool, moana,jungle cruise,the kingsman, this shows have alot in common and they are seriously  funny! Unlike how hollywood had a time that only made super-hero movies! Venom another very fun movie,look-out, etc! Action is ok ,but has to have fun and laughs"
If Dwayne wasn’t an actor I think he would be a wrestling coach
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=6m45s"">6:45</a><br>I just realized that Ryan, Gal, and Dwayne are parents to only girls."
"I enjoyed this movie, That Part When.... Nah I&#39;m just kidding 😂 I&#39;m hoping there will be another. They all are really unique together."
"Deadpool, Wonder Woman and Black Adam sitting with eachother"
"Reporter: “Mr. Johnson what will your campaign slogan be for 2024?”<br>Rock: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=7m54s"">7:54</a>"
1. They know nothing about each other.<br>2. They have stellar people skills. 😅
"<a href=""https://youtu.be/TXkc6Pqvwpc"">https://youtu.be/TXkc6Pqvwpc</a><br>New vlog!💉🩹🎥🎥😍😍"
How is Dwayne whiter than Gal &amp; Ryan....
Gal Gadot &amp; Ryan Renolds keeps their legs together the whole time.<br>....The Rock embraces his space.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=2m51s"">2:51</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m02s"">3:02</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m13s"">3:13</a> The Rock just continuously bounces his compliments back to Gal. What a gent."
Sorry but gal is not a good actrist as dwayne and ryan are.. especially dwayne and emily blunt were incredible at the screen.. gal cannot give this energy..being beautiful is not enough..
Deadpool Wonder Women and Black Adam
Why they saying dj.. That&#39;s the rock
Really waiting for the next movie with these 3 stars
Blake knowing more about the spice girls than the spice girls 😂<br>Blake and Emma Stone would get along. Still waiting for this collab/project
I highly doubt you&#39;re in their budget 😂😂😂😂😂 the realism is real
They all became a DC superheroes/villain
Questions that should have these answers <br>1. Doing another terrible superhero movie.<br>2. Electricuting DJ (apparently that is what fellow celebrities call him now) in the testicles.<br>3. Pro wrestler (please don&#39;t go back to Canadian football you suck at it.)<br>4. Set it all free by scarlett johansson<br>5. Palates<br>6. Everytime his kids mention the tooth fairy or his daughter not believing he was maui<br>7. Deadpool 3 and Canadian Bacon
I lost count of how many times Gal &amp; DJ laugh because of Ryan 😂
This exactly what I needed to see!! Lol 😭❤️❤️
Ryan my man i love u
love them but the movie sucks.
The way they are respecting each other. ❤️
Just saw the movie. I loved it but I feel like Ryan carried it lmao he&#39;s hilarious
Ad 1 of 2 is 15 secs... oh man. Like changed to dislike and video abandoned.
Ryan is ryan himself in his movies
This movie was absolutely amazing!! I’m happy that it saved Netflix
Promos are basically haiku
"Ryan, your brand is called AVIATION American Gin."
Wish she hadnt learnt english...was more fun then
&#39;Hold On&#39; was prominently featured in Harold &amp; Kumar... A movie which had a Ryan Reynolds cameo
"Put Hugh Jackman, ryan and jack together"
Ryan is the smartest and most funnier guy I have ever seen 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Gal is such a typical Israeli woman - I lived there for a couple of years and the women there are so friendly, relaxed…and hot!!"
Ryan scared of airplanes ≠ named his drink aviation gin 😅
Great movie good action and comedy
Big fan of you guys 🇧🇩💚💚💚🇧🇩
"Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Black Adam"
Red notice could have been better. Wasn&#39;t a great movie
uhhh my dude&#39;s scared of airplanes but has an alcohol company called aviation.
deadpool and black adam vs wonder woman ???? hmmm interesting
Gal Galdot gots an evil about herself. What&#39;s she so insecure about?
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=8m01s"">8:01</a> I don’t think gal was talking about coke lmao"
Very cool.🍍
DJ outfit always killing it !
Done watching 😀❤️👍
"I wonder if DJ could get his legs any wider apart, lol."
Only Ryan can make DJ seem not so funny
Dj would be a male stripper
Great movie!  Very fun and enjoyable to watch all of you!  Thank you
I want these three to apologise to Netflix for spending $200m on such a dreadful movie.<br>Red Notice was f****ng rubbish!
Nice
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a> what makes DJ laugh it&#39;s KEVIN HEART 😂"
Ryan is emotion king
Can u imagine the Rock berating someone up for a low score
pootangpie ryan
Imagine having an ex as hot as Gal
Gal and the rock dancing lol. Would watch. Ryan always funny
Sheeee is cute
"so the answer is, none of them know anything about each otther"
Were their laughter a bit cringe or is it just me?
Yet his Gin is called Aviation. Ironic
is that a green screen behind them?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m32s"">3:32</a> Gal forgot that shes an hollywood actress for a moment XD"
"For your information, this &#39;&#39;wonder woman&#39;&#39; served in the israeli military, pursuing an illegal war, killing and harming daily innocent children<br>Pretty ironic/hypocritical considering the role she portrays, appering as a hero"
lol they don&#39;t have chemistry or they&#39;re all being so careful or they&#39;re a bit dull
this movie was great lots of comedy and action
They’re all just calling him DJ now and I don’t know how to feel about it 😂😂
I love you guys but specially to Gal Gadot  you are my sunshine 🌞
What’s the rocks crop top thing
Did anyone else think the answer to the first question was going to be Green Lantern related?
"These interviews are so natural and great... The movie sucked balls, though.<br><br>Ryan&#39;s occasional one liners seemed to be the only semi-redeeming part of an otherwise hopeless film.<br><br>Love all 3 of them - but was gutted to see them participate in such a unsophisticated, childish movie. I understand it was for the money, though."
I loved the movie i&#39;m already waiting for the sequel!!!
"Hollywood: We need a Muscle man, a Beautiful face and Ryan Reynolds.<br>Writers: Ok, Ryan will be one of the stars we only need a name change.<br>Rest of Us: Oh cool another Ryan Reynolds movie.<br><br>Love Gal, DJ and Ryan this movie will entertain easily, those 3 are probably the 3 highest charisma actors in Hollywood currently. Just my opinion though there are lots of greats out there."
Gal....
Love the movie hope they in more projects together
"like Ryan however I want back my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=1m57s"">1:57</a> minutes I spent watching their movie"
They don&#39;t know anything about each other but they have great chemistry!
Ryan doesnt like planes? His gin is literally called aviation lmao
I don&#39;t like it when they call him DJ.... it&#39;s weird. Great interview BTW.
"The guy who used to own Aviation Gin is scared of flying? Oh, the irony 🤣"
I keep seeing Deadpool!
Pie Hookers! 😂
"This movie was a lot of fun, highly recommend."
Straight up gal is simping over ryan
"imagine a movie with DJ , RYAN REYNOLDS , K HART , GG and RDJ<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>full package"
Anything Ryan says is hilarious. I know the movie set was so much fun.
I’ve glad that the Rock and Ryan made a film together
I’m just- WOW! Netflix never could have found a better cast then this one!
Ryan spends the most on ankle weights. They completely rejuvenated his career. 🍍
"If you haven&#39;t seen the movie, this interview is pretty much the movie. It&#39;s just 3 charming actors on a fun thrill ride.👍"
This people don&#39;t know each other.
They seem so smart and connected it is beyond my understanding how they delivered such a brain dead horrible movie. I guess the money was good.
Bruh pls it weird that they r comfortable calling him DJ
Kevin Hart is so jealous seeing this interview
I think Ryan should play as deadpool
"Fun fact ,all 3 are or have been DC super heroes."
Gal Gadot is beautiful.
3 egotistical fools
It&#39;s So Bad that it actually hurts to watch it 😭 😪 😫 😢<br>It actually make &quot;6 Underground&quot; look like and Academy Award Winning Movie! 🎬
"Why does Dwayne always have great chemistry with his co stars. Always seems like best friends when he does interviews with them, must be a great guy"
deadpool vs wonder woman vs black adam who will in?
"THANK YOU for NOT cutting out the swear words, SO much better to not hear all the beeping."
gal seems fake
I use so many Kleenex because of Gal.
It’s a shame not even Wonder Woman could save Red Notice. Pretty to look at though.
"No lie all I see is Deadpool, Wonder Woman and Black Adam 🤣🤣🤣"
Gal Gadot &lt;3 &lt;3
So cool and funny!😂
"And Ryan has an alcoholic beverage called Aviation 🤣. Oh, the irony."
I like Ryan Reynolds Dead Pool and Wonder Woman!! The Rock would be a good Marvel Apocalypse!!!
"Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Black Adam"
Ryan makes both Gal and DJ look funnier than they really are :D Love it
Rock is so lucky he get to Kiss Gal
It&#39;s funny when they call the rock DJ
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=3m26s"">3:26</a> obviously wrestling or culturism wtf 🤷‍♂"
"Cocaine pie made by <a href=""http://hookers.lol/"">hookers.lol</a>"
DJ
I’m not one of those people who get all googly eyed over celebrities… but I would just love to shake Ryan’s hand..not cause he is a great actor..not cause he’s deadpool…but cause he help find that woman’s missing teddy bear that had her mom’s last message to her before she died…that gave me mad respect for him…
I&#39;d say the rock would be a personal trainer tbh
Who else loves Gal over here...😊
❤️
Scared of planes...owner of Aviation Gin...
Fire Movie🔥
"All I see is <br>Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Black Adam<br>secretly hanging out"
Ryan&#39;s answer are not too serious lol
Awesome
Fire Movie🔥
"Ryan did the heavy lifting in this interview too..<br>I know the other two were good but Ryan Reynolds was fun to watch in Red Notice, he was everything you expect him to be in that movie."
I GOT ONLY TWO FEET LMAO 💀
I&#39;m today years old that Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman
"Great fun and entertaining trio in this video, luv Gal&#39;s coolness seating there in betwenn these 2 men but they dont know much about beach other, what matters is they have good perhaps great chemestry!! -1 point to the Rock on his what always makes me laugh answer as he aint always filming with them jaja am sure he laughs hard at some of his daily things!.. PD  what&#39;s with the DJ thing now....jajaja! enjoy y&#39;all!!"
"Deadpool, wonder woman, black Adam... 😍🥺🥺😲"
Can&#39;t really tell when Ryan is acting or not!
Red notice is basically just a poorly done hollywood version of Lupin III without the charisma or humor jesus christ
"When The Rock question about what would he would be doing if not acting, Ryan&#39;s face... Was thinking he would write down, &quot;Being a big brother somewhere.&quot; 😂"
"Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Black Adam"
"I stopped watching when they do the car chase scene as it has become too generic for me, it&#39;s like another Fast and Furious movie"
Gal gadot is overrated af.
WOW
Well of course Dwayne dances like a ballerina. He was taught in game plan lmao
&quot;My toes were a bit nervous&quot; <br>Hhahahahaha
Deadpool - Wonder Woman - Black Adam
three superhumans in a interview together
"Gotta love this <b>Deadpool, Wonder Woman, Black Adam</b> interview xD!"
We can all agree that Ryan is nestling with his kids watching this video in real time!
Ryan is Amazing 😍🤣
So dwayne can dance too<br>im done
I liked Emily and Dwayne interviews better.. those two were just so perfect...! &lt;3
Is &#39;DJ&#39; white now or what..?
The person who is terrified of airplanes played hal jordan. WOW😂
DJ
So we learned they do not know each other very well at all!
חס וחלילה טפו טפו טפו
"I had to watch it in spanish and it was sgreat movie, cant wait to stream in english"
I love this trio.
"Just realized I&#39;m little bit like ryan, I spent money on sneakers more than other things and I&#39;m afraid of heights-airplanes 🤭"
Dwayne Johnson he will return wrestling to the wwe 2022 on April at the  Wrestlemania 38 to challenge Roman reigns for the universal championship
So in summary they dont know each other that well
I love Gal
Never expected DJ to answer Haiku Poet
They are the best trio 😍😍
Big love to you Gal :)
"I&#39;d definitely say minus acting, Rock would probably be a wrestler....idk why, just seems like it would suit him. May start off pretty rough with chants of &#39;Die Rocky, die&#39; ...but I&#39;m certain he&#39;d make it through."
Can&#39;t still get over the fact that the most electrifying man in all of universe has made such an amazing career in Hollywood.
It&#39;s just impossible that Gal Gadot is the third wheel here but that happened.
The holy trinity of actors
God forbid The Rock runs for President of the United States.
I love her accent.
Very funny! That Adam Sandler/Aniston murderer movie was also super funny! Netflix got something going on 🥳
The Wok
"The hottest person making me Hard, gal gadot and dwayne is ok too i guess..."
Great 🌹🦋🌹🦋🌹🦋🦋🌹🦋🌹🌹
"Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Black Adam together"
Really hope they do another Red Notice movie...it was so funny and good
She is overcast by the male giants on her wings... she i thought owned a room but NOT this one. She is pedestrian.
Hates airplanes but calls his booze company Aviation Gin.HAHAHAHAHA
waiting for them to address INDIA
"Fun segment, it&#39;s pitty Red Notice turned out to be the most forgettable and the least original flick ever. A waste of money and talent."
"Nice to see Deadpool (or Green Lantern?), Wonder Woman, and Black Adam hanging out, lol."
"They have bad chemistry, and it showed in the movie, you can&#39;t compare this chemistry to the one Dwayne and Emily had in jungle cruise"
The 3 of them have such great chemistry! You can tell they are all good friends. ☺️
“We we’re wasting Netflix’s time and money” lol only a superstar can relate cause they won’t get fired
Shout out to the graphic artist for making the digital scoreboard knowing it very likely wouldn&#39;t be used.
3 top superstars in Hollywood now ! !
can we all agree that this movies humor was SpOt On👌🏻
Ryan op
"Ryan, Gal and DJ ♥️♥️♥️"
Not the timotheè joke slander 😂😂
Cool!
"Ryan plays himself in every movie he stars in.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>There are some exceptions,obviously..."
Lol they are so cute😆👍💜
Gal 0.55😍
You guys should do the same with Love Hard cast
"&quot;What would i be doing, if I wasn&#39;t an actor?&quot;  I mean wrestling, right?"
Those three!!!
awkward. but respect
&quot;Presidant&quot;
They know nothing about each other lol. But i like that they tried
"I think when Ryan said “I highly doubt you are in their budget “I guess he was trying to say that they can’t afford Dwayne Johnson,which is a FACT..Man that dude is expensive nowadays!"
So she was cheating on Han lue with Hobbs and faked her own death?
This movie was complete trash.
Ryan literally plays himself in most movies he’s just quirky like that so fun to watch
Who cares?
"deadpool, wonder woman and the rock in one movie? <br>Sounds great!"
If Dwayne Johnson wasn’t an actor he would’ve been a wrestler
Boring carp.
I am just wondering how did The Rock NOT say anything about &quot;eating pie&quot;. Just watch his promos and he talked a LOT about all sorts of pies 😉😉
What would Dwayne be if not an actor?<br>Random Answers ....<br>The Rock&#39;s Whole Wrestling Career: 🤨🤨🤨
I forget that all 3 of them were in some of the fast and furious movies.
Really blahh guys
great entertaining movie failed to be clever with it&#39;s plot twist and Ryan need to stop playing the same type of character now it&#39;s getting annoying but it was fun to watch funny at times and sometimes way over the top but yes a nice film to watch
Gal is insanely gorgeous and so chill
I can just imagine these 3 on HOT ONES! It would be an AWESOME interview!
WELL THAT WAS FUNNY
"I can&#39;t stand Gal Gadot, I would have enjoyed the movie more if she wasn&#39;t in it."
Ryan Reynolds’s is a national treasure….
Wow this is better than the movie
"Afraid of airplanes, names vodka brand “aviator”… is this the same Bruce Wayne/Batman logic going on"
Ryan is the moment
Ryan really likes to say &#39;WOW&#39;.
Freckles 😂😂
Can&#39;t wait to see Black Adam.
I REALLY love these 3 people. <br>But this interview&#39;s got a real awkward vibe to it. It&#39;s like 3 super cool people with no chemestry trying to be funny and pretend they are best friends.
Lovely people and the movie is exactly what I needed! I hope we get more of them
"חס וחלילה טפו טפו טפו 😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m56s"">0:56</a>"
Free Palestine
This movie is so predictable. Boring..
"Ryan Reynolds is gonna be on complex soon, MMW"
"Dead pool, Wonder Woman, Black Adam"
How about pro wrestling lol
"Gal looks wonderful like always, love that shiny top!"
Ryan is this much close replacing  Kevin Hart as Dwayne&#39;s best friend
"Thank God for Ryan Reynolds... Kinda liked The Rock&#39;s banter with Kevin Hart, this... nice DJ... what is this. Everyone has to be nice to Gal Gadot!!"
Gal calls him DJ!! Aww
Ryan&#39;s dressing sense is so freakingly casually awesome 🤘 👏
Literally ANYTHING ryan reynolds does:<br>People: 🤣😂😆🤭
Would have loved to see that DJ impression by Ryan.
"HONESTLY, 3 actors that deserve respect"
Ya’lls caused an entire globe in our local area to go missing.
Whenever I see Gal Gadot: B O B  S P O N G E
"Deadpool, Wonder Woman and black adam"
Presidant
As much as I crush on Gal Gadot... I clicked on this video for Ryan&#39;s jokes...
Doopender
This could&#39;ve been a Justice League spin off if Green Lantern didn&#39;t suck. 😅
Zero chemistry 🤣
ok i am not meaning to be rude in any way i love all three of these actors but look at the way that ryan is sitting at the start. exactly the same as gal and then you see the rock 🤣
RYAN ASNIWPWKSIWKSKS
Ryan is the guy pal
i think it might be the first time ive ever seen the rock nervous in an interview since hes not controlling it. i think youd only see the rock like this in an interview with ryan
Gap Gadot...the most confident woman!! She’s so herself
"“Standing next to you makes me look like Timothee Chalamet!!” I love how they call Dwayne, DJ😭😭😭😂😂"
These people are so fake and stupid. <br>Especially that dude who&#39;s kind of cross-eyed and thinks he&#39;s funny. He&#39;s not.
"6/10<br>OKAY MOVIE BUT SURE $ LOSS.<br>GREAT ACTORS, OKAY TWIST, FUNNY CAMEO SOMEHOW RAISED THE SCORE."
the trio i never knew i needed
😙😊😍
It&#39;s great to see all three together. 😇
The Rock looks like he&#39;s got some plastic surgery...?
"Long shot, but can anyone tell me what Gal says at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m55s"">0:55</a>? I can guess the gist of it based on context but I like to know the actual meaning. Like did she do 3 &#39;spits&#39;? Ik in Greece and a couple other places that&#39;s a thing against curses/bad luck"
Can gal be my alarm clock her voice is so magical
I thought Ryan was gonna be afraid of losing aviation gin. But airplanes. His brand is <b>aviation</b> gin. And aviation is about planes.
I loved gal playing a villain I can’t wait for her to play the evil queen in Snow White next year
3 fuckwits in 1 place....go figure
Gal is the hottest yet funniest person
Gal is so graceful 😍
they have such great vibes
Imagine all the people
This movie had soooo much plot twist in it I swear
Get yourself someone that looks at you like how Gal looks at Ryan
The movie was funny in unexpected places.
Green lantern wonder woman and black adam in another universe….
DJ? DJ??<br><br>Yeah okay. I think that works.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=8m23s"">8:23</a> hahah hes soo cuteee i love him ;3"
Good on Gal for being heart felt. And sincere. Bravo Dwayne. Haiku. ♥️
טפו טפו טפו
Ryan scared of planes ...plays hal jordon ...a pilot...<br><br>No wonder
3 alpha personalities
Worst movie ever!!!!
"Wonder Woman, Deadpool and Black Adam all walk into a bar...."
This movie was terrible. Sad to say.
&quot;Daddy what does maui mean by hookers and blow?!&quot; Ahahahahahhaha busted a lung
Their movie I watched on Netflix was great. Called Red Notice. Good movie 4 out of 5 for me
"Marvel - 1, DC - zero"
"When gal says Ryan likes Pies, my mind instantly turned dirty mode."
"Total cheap garbage, the movie if you can call it that. Begins to self-destruct right off the bat, within seconds it transforms it self into a cartoon where gravity doesn&#39;t matter, regular actors jump, fall like superheroes, the inevitable fruit stand. Basically studio heads giving you flashy music, stunts, and no story. No character development.Its basically a video game, a commercial. By the time they end up in the same cell, you basically DON&#39;T CARE about them, the supposed story, this so called movie or anything except turning it off so you can find something better to watch. Expensive trash, with big name stars still trash.Goes to show you can put lip stick on a pig but  it&#39;s still a pig. skip it.  Wait... who  is it good for? who will enjoy it? most likely children (or slow witted adults) between the ages or 6-12yrs. maybe 6-10yrs."
Dont waste your time
"Sooo, we got green lantern, wonder woman, and black adam here?"
"Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Black Adam sitting together."
Perfect trio
These three are very pretty!
This chemistry is so good they need another movie!
"Aku yang berterimakasih untuk karya-karya indah yang telah Gal sayang, Mr. DJ, Mr. Ryan dan istilahnya apa Gal..? Hollywood people..? berikan kepada dunia.."
I love U so much Gal..
"Saat lalu aku melihat film-film yang diperankan oleh Mr. DJ dan Ryan.. Sekarang aku menitipkan salam melalui Gal the Wonder Woman..  Kadang aku berpikir, sebenarnya apa yang sedang terjadi dengan hidupku.."
Did Ryan sink in between those legends?
Gal sayang.. Gal cantik.. salam untuk Mr. Ryan Reynolds..
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=0m04s"">0:04</a> you make me look like  Timothée Chalamet 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Remember when people used to call him &quot;The Rock&quot;?
"&quot;DJ&quot; just don&#39;t sit right. He&#39;s the Great One. The People&#39;s Champion. The Brahma Bull. The Most Electryfing Man in All of Entertainment. The jabroni beating, pie eating, trail blazing, eyebrow raising, the Rock."
loved the movie love all 3 of them. and i think gals accent as improved alot.
These guys seem really comfortable and relaxed with each other. I loved this almost as much as the interviews with Dwayne and Emily Blunt. They cracked me right up. They all seem like funny cool friends.
"Dwayne is a Taurus, Ryan is a Scorpio… Opposite signs and they’re displaying opposite energy…it’s uncanny"
Is Ryan a comedian? any line he says is hilarious lol
They had amazing chemistry and it was fun seeing the 3 biggest action stars right now! I am really hoping we get a sequel or another project with the three of them!
"I love the 3 of them Ryan, Gal and Dj!!! 😘🥰😍💜"
"The sheer class that is Gal Gadot in between a couple goofy albeit lovable heathens…. Dwayne, Ryan… you two are some of the best in my book. ‘Southland Tales’, Dwayne. Ryan… ‘The Voices’… so underrated… but you’re both mere henchmen to the Queen that is Gal."
"&quot;Red Notice&quot; is insulting drivel. Expensive, but still drivel. Godot and Johnson&#39;s salaries together are more than the budgets of many films. Like cheap gum, the movie is tasteless and easily forgotten. Good pay day for everyone involved but a ripoff for the viewer."
"Chas ve&#39;chalila, tfu tfu tfu 😂"
"I think Ryan was a little forced to be reserve here for his comedy.  Put him with other comedics and he&#39;d destroy!  ( you just don&#39;t make fun of the most beautiful woman alive....and if you make fun of The Rock, you&#39;d be his preworkout breakfast.)"
Gal is absolutely gorgeous!!!!!!!!
if put them on movie. gal gadot charter brought on batchleret show. she get million dollars eliminated everyone els. Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson realize only two left. rest movie them try hurt or get ride of each other before the final 3 shows were she decides who marry give have money too. my pitch for movie.
I love you guys and I love this new movie Red ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I&#39;m one of y&#39;all&#39;s biggest fan
Ryan and Dwayne are the full spectrum of healthy masculinity.
Just watched the movie this morning it was really good and all three of them did an amazing job and ryan reynolds was really funny in thia movie
Love It when Gal speeks heberew
Did Ryan always talk like that or did he come out the closet recently? What am i missing here?
gal is so funny and charming
DJ is a so lucky  GUY emily blunt on jungle cruise and now gal gadot :(
my god this film was so bad. one of the worse I&#39;ve seen in my life.
"these three are the worst actors in the world, literally, these 3 are BAAAAAD."
Dwayne is out here looking like Toretto’s lost brother hahahaha
the laughing so fake like yall are actors
"She is so beautiful, like WTF how is this allowed"
I loved it
I didn&#39;t realize how much I needed to see these 3 together until now.
Rock looking so good in that jacket!
Green Lantern <br>Wonder Woman<br>Black Adam
BOYCOTT THIS MOVIE GAL GODOT IS A ZIONIST (pirate this movie if you really want to watch it)
Ryan is cool
<b>DEADPOOL</b>
🐾
Ryan Reynolds karaoke song has to be I swear
Gal Gadot is too serious
I love this trio!! 😆
Dj looks different why tho?
ryan reynolds is hot and also death to israel and every adult israeli
"Тьфу-тьфу-тьфу!!! (In russian a bunch of siunds pronounced to avoid all possible disasters she mentioned beforehand) <br><br>Gal is my personal goddess, aaahaahahah"
"Their chemistry <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23100"">#100</a>"
😍😍😍awesome movie♥️♥️♥️
the chemistry here is amazing. i feel like they&#39;re friends for life and will try to start making even more netflix movies together just to hang out
Ryan Reynolds should have invited Gal Tarot and Dwayne Johnson to his plantation wedding at Boone Hall  with Blake Lively.
They’re so comfortable with each other. They have chemistry a woman and 2 guys in action! More projects please!
lindos. Super fã de vocês.
Like they did terrible but i love them hahahahahaha
"I need the 5th year of Billie Eilish YA, and with Spanish subtitles 😭"
Rock loves pies
I love how much they know about each other.. l
Red notice is a bad CGI movie.
The movie is amazing!
The rock committed on using only FAKE guns in all of his movies moving forward. Lame.
It’s starting to feel like there’s a cult of personality around these three in Hollywood
Gadot is...drop dead gorgeous. I live for her smile.
What movie is the Rock not in these days
"Red Notice was a fun movie,Gal Gadot is just so gorgeous 😍"
Whoever chose Robert Clotworthy for Red Notice&#39;s opening narration is an absolute genius!!!
biggest fear. <br>Ryan Reynolds :  watching green lantern
You can&#39;t just put three of my favorite people together and not expect me to be entertained
"Deadpool, Wonder woman and Black Adam make a formidable team. Let&#39;s see them face off with the Eternals."
is it only me? or does calling Dwayne &quot;DJ&quot; doesn&#39;t feel like him??
When 2 zodiac Taurus (GG &amp; TR) having fun with the one scorpio! (RR) this is too funny😂
I hope black Adam and green lantern  gets involved in the justice league soon <br>Would be nice to see them there
yeah no chemistry here whatsoever lol feels forced 😬
"Put Kevin Hart to DJ, Hugh Jackman to Ryan &amp; Chris Pine to Gal Gadot. Everyone gets full points."
Their chemistry is 🔥
Ryan doesn&#39;t really have to act! It&#39;s just him in the movie! Really fun movie btw!
Let&#39;s be real for a second. We all know Ryan&#39;s biggest fear is catching a glimpse of Green Lantern on TV
"Black Adam, Wonder Woman and Deadpool test to see how well they know each other"
Idk how many times Ryan tried impersonating the rock. But it was pretty spot on lol
טפו טפו טפו : -)
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=7m56s"">7:56</a> 1st time in life when Ryan looked uncomfortable 😂"
They are flirting <br>Ryan: you two are cute <br>Ryan again :kill me now
"I’m just here to say that President Donald. J Trump will be elected for a third time in 2024, Rittenhouse is an American hero, progressive liberal scumbags are the only virus Americans are worried about, and LET’S GO BRANDON.  Put that in your pipes and smoke it…..freaks 😂😘"
Love Dwayne’s man spreading Alpha seated pose! It’s hilarious! Reminds of the time when Kevin Hart said Dwayne had ladies thighs! 😂
"Awesome trio to have together, love just seeing them be themselves and crack up jokes."
DJ does manspreading like no man&#39;s business
umm...<br>GREEN LANTERN VS WONDER WOMAN VS BLACK ADAM
"These 3 are perfect together. Gal is more serious, but it works so well with the other 2 being so goofy lol."
It was a good movie
"What would the Rock do if he wasn&#39;t an actor? ... Like... Even while being an actor he still does everything else. Sell tequila, is basically an amateur bodybuilder, ex professional wrestler, ex football player, according to Gal he has some moves on the dance floor.<br>What would he not be is the real question"
&quot;my toes were quite nervous&quot; 😂
I kept wondering who “DJ” was this entire video lol
This is the first time my eyes weren’t fixated on Gal Gadot the whole time. Ryan Reynolds has my heart.
"The man I want to be my best friend ,the girl I want to be my wife ,and my big  brother wonderful people"
Ryan should go sneaker shopping with complex
"Ryan is just so hilarious.. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUlb_G6v7ec&amp;t=8m23s"">8:23</a><br>Calling Dwayne as Maui.. 🤣<br><br>&quot;Daddy, what does Maui mean by hookers and blow?&quot;"
Ryan Reynolds is the funny in any situation
Ryan got cheated by Rock in movie<br>Omg i almost believed they r best couple in the movie
<b>Which ones father is da best?</b>
i thought the movie was great
I&#39;m a fan of timmy..unfortunately i totally agree what ryan said...
"Fr Gal is becoming an icon day by day, I love her for being comfy sitting casually and the timothee chalamet reference ryan😂"
poor timothee chalamet LMAOO
&quot;...<br>especially the leather ones 😂 &quot;
Gal my cutie cutie cutie cutie
YOU MAKE ME LOOK LIKE TIMOTHEE CHALAMET cried
Is this movie any good?
BRO IT’S BLUE SHIRT GUY
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Damnnnm these 3 people are just Gorgeous, I can&#39;t stop looking at them, especially their faces😄"
ed shereran’s cameo was the best thing I have ever seen
"that women imbarresed herself inn2020 by singing imagine , rich people am I right tacky"
Bts will be awsome of this movie
The passion in Ryan&#39;s voice when he said &#39;I love pies&#39;.  :-)
They’re officially my favourite cast❤️ love them
"I see Deadpool, Wonder Woman, Black Adam"
Gal is lucky she&#39;s hot. She&#39;s either trying too hard to be on their level of funny or just weird
"Ryan is Ellen&#39;s supporter. He was trying to invalidate the horrible experiences of Ellen&#39;s employees by saying that He, a rich and famous celebrity had been treated well by Ellen. I will never watch his movies again."
Kevin hart will be jealous
OK GOOD!!
Gal Gadot&#39;s so tall she makes the Rock look normal sized.
Wonder Woman<br>The Rock<br>Deadpool<br>All in the same movie together.<br><br>Two ♉vs  1 ♏
"When I realised I couldn&#39;t stand flying, I learned to accept if it is my time to go, i would have to accept its time to go."
Respect 👍💪
The Fact I saw Dwayne Johnson was looking annoyed 😊😂
he had better chemistry with Emily blunt LOL
"Black Adam, wonder Woman, Deadpool! Together 😭😭😭"
Why Ryan always steal the show
Loved the Vanity Fair Rock cover story 😃🙌
Why do I fell like Ryan&#39;s vibes was a lil bit off in here? He sounds tired a lil tbh...
if the pie is made entirely of cocaine....lmao
&quot;I highly doubt you&#39;re in their budget&quot;<br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
Gal &quot;A WHAT?!&quot;
i love that ryan is sat like gal
Lol
ryan is actually timothee chalamet compared to Dawane jonson in ACTING !!!
good cast ! crap movie ! thank god i didn&#39;t pay for it !
"They are so wholesome, what a trio!!"
"Dwayne Johnson running for potus while portraying himself as the devil and coincidentally, like Hitler, shares a strong interest in King Kong and Disney films. Can you smell what the rock is cooking 🤢👺"
Ryan is always funny.
25 years later Spice Girls are still constantly mentioned almost every single day! Haters to the left. Legendary.
You would play a good grinch my friend thinks you won’t so I need u to prove him wrong
DJ.. Hahahahahahaha throughout the interview
Deadpool crossover to dc universe
Awesome
That movie sucked! Ryan has really found his niche but he is basically the same guy telling lame jokes while  wearing a different costume design in every movie. Gal Gadots favorite scene is when they threw shade at vin diesel who literally helped launch her non-existent career. 😂
Marvel &amp; DC doing collabs.
These three are legends
This cast is so frickin incredible all you need is Margot Robbie and Tom hiddleston and you have my celebrity top 5
They remind me of the friend group that can be chill together and low key goof off and are just there to have a good time
Lol the rocks constant fake laugh 😂
I cant stand these hollywood dolts and all the people that praise them
Gal Gadot ruined the movie
Gal&#39;s not winning any spelling bees.... PRESIDANT... 😂
So he named it Aviation Gin... cause he has to down it to fly? ✈️🍸😂
The owner of &quot;Aviation&quot; Gin is afraid of planes
<b>CATS</b>
The move was beyond excellent and the cast was super excellent
They are all in superhero shape.
Very cute!!!
Why there&#39;s no scene that shows Dwayne&#39;s Cooking?
Ryan is the funniest guy in hollywood
Rock&#39;s ultimate man spreading
Can&#39;t wait. I&#39;m gonna see this tonight. 👍
"Ah yes, a zionist war criminal and some great actors. Look at her smile now that she has killed humans and children with her own hands"
I’m sorry but I was completely distracted by Dwayne’s thighs… also when asked what would Dwayne do if he wasn’t an actor why did no one put wrestler?!
"These 3 are the best, I need to see this movie. 😍"
POV: you just realized how funny Ryan actually is in irl
"mostly old generation in Poland do &quot;tfu tfu tfu&quot; while saying something you wouldn&#39;t wish to happen like god forbid stuff, its funny how its the same"
Ryan biggest fear is GREEN LANTERN
"Hal, Diana, Adam <br>DC Dark Universe forever"
Crap film
The crew
when is the billie interview cominggggg ugh
Enjoyed d movie ... ALL the twists &amp; turns. 💓🙌😊
THE MOVIE WAS GREAT
i think this was the rocks best movie so far
This only shows that they need to make a sequel so that they retake this...😂<br><br><br>And fail hilariously once again...
They’re all DC characters…<br>And one is a really good Marvel character…
<b>Ryan is the coolest guy in Hollywood</b>
Timothée Chalamet about to go wild knowing Ryan Reynolds just named bombed him xD
Gal:God forbid krffdexaaadfrrgvvjjnbgg
"Black Adam, Wonder Woman and Deadpool.   Deadpool must pick a side.  Hero or villain"
"This was ok, but the drunk interviews for jungle cruise with Dwayne and Emily blunt are forever going to be my favourite. Disney even put them on notice while they were on the circuit to be more &quot;family friendly&quot;"
😆😆😆😆 they don&#39;t know each other at all
OMG!!! This is so funny. Gal is the only adult and sentimental here. Ryan with his wit and quick mouth. There were so many comedy punch lines in the movie thanks to him. The Rock cracked up at one joke in the movie. Great set!!
If the Rock wasn’t an actor he would be a full time rapper fs🤣
I couldn’t stop smiling throughout the whole interview.
I wish kevin Hart could answer that part &quot;if dj wasn&#39;t an actor what would he be doing&quot; 😂
Dwaynes aggressive man spreading and Ryans constipated leg crossing are cracking me up with the contrast.
SPICE girls in records HISTORy in gueneas of book records in history. 😘💜💜
the dream trio omfg
Hi Ms Universe Esrael beauty Ms. Galgadot and Hello to Mr. Ryan Reynolds and Mr. D Rock in my 90&#39;s  wrestling of Mr. Dwayne&#39;s The Rock.<br>😘💜💜💜💜
Dwayne looks so white in this video. Its weird
DJ with Kevin Hart is much more hilarious
Gal spelled the president of USA wrong!
"Oh look, the palestian kids murderess."
"Can&#39;t stand airplanes, owns Aviation Gin... Oh Ryan."
"I can’t stand Gal Gadot, so this is a no see for me."
"Ah, rich pretty people making money. Always great during an inflationary winter/covid resurgence."
Why does Gal not wear a wedding ring?
"Deadpoll, Wonder Woman, and Black Adam answer questions about each other."
Gal gadot is a b*** convince me she is not
this is cool
"I love them, they are a great team<br>Gal is so perfect, help"
Truly is a unicorn stuck outta time 🌈
Wonder woman singing Spice Girls LEGENDARY especially for a bloke English fella 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love them togetherrrr
Hamsa hamsa hamsa 🖐🏼🖐🏼🖐🏼🖐🏼🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
Man spreading over there 🕵
"Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Black Adam in the same room."
The way gal and Ryan sit the same way and the rock just man spreads
Me still waiting for the 5th billie interview 😭😭
Ok but these are really difficult questions lol
I love them all so much
"I LOVE how Gal just went for a realistic comfortable sitting and cross her legs wide open, relatable af."
They forgot to beep those words
Jesus is your way to heaven Believe in him and you will have life after death. He shed his blood for your sins to be forgiven.

"How many others expected the interview to start with Ryan saying, &quot;I&#39;m a Marvel&quot; and Gal &amp; DJ saying, &quot;and we&#39;re a DC.&quot; ??"
🎵 imagine there&#39;s no heaven 🎵
They should start shooting the sequel already.
Gal is just perfect
In love with this movie omg
This gal murderer is still showing up?! Ask her how many Palestinian did she kill.
Love the movie!
"Imagine Ryan Reynolds, Kevin Hart and Dwayne &#39; Rock &#39; Johnson together in a movie."
Gosh that movie Was boring

I came here to find Vin Diesel&#39;s audition tape for CATS .. That would be Epic
"Deadpool/Green lantern, Wonder woman &amp; Black adam.. Nice chemistry"
Brilliant film
"Green lantern , Wonder women, Black adam"
Emely Energy not found
Wow Gal  Ghetto. Way to suck off DJ and make RR feel dumb.
Three of my favourite love them what a trio
These team we didn&#39;t knew we needed♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I was wondering why they were both calling him DJ....then it hit me
epic movie to watch
"Lord I loved this movie 🥺🥺🥺 the stunts, the humor all of it 😍😍😍😍"
Rock
lmfao is the Rock gonna literally run for office? like as part of a bit though right? not for real? <br>wtf is going on in this world!
The most chaotic trio I’ve seen in an interview. What great fun to watch🤣
"Reynolds to Gadot: <b>&quot;I&#39;m married and happy, I can&#39;t help you with that one.&quot;</b><br><br>You can tell anything you want about Ryan Reynolds, but you have to hold a high level mastery of comedic quipping if you&#39;re capable to throw shade at a close friend and acting partner about her antics alongside other male acting partners/friends (Ben Affleck, Chris Pine, Henry Cavill-- although he never reciprocated it because Cavill just want to act) anytime she&#39;s at an interview or photoshoot, and having your lady friend acting like &quot;hm, okay. The shade was hilarious&quot;. 🤣"
They really don’t know each other 😂😂
Gal is very beautiful
"&quot;I highly doubt you&#39;re in their budget,&quot; that laugh was too big because it was real lol"
גל ימושלמתתת
Timothée Chalamet wishes he was Ryan.
"You have no idea, I clicked so fast on this"
In all of these Red Notice interviews all they talk about is how good they all know eachother and their chemistry yet scoring zero here 😂 btw a great trio 🔥
"Holy cow, Ryan Reynolds is frigging hilarious..."
A movie with these 3 can&#39;t be bad!
Love women with uninhibited big laughs
They&#39;re all great siblings!
Loved this interview and I watched the the movie and I loved it and it was so worth watching.🤩💛🤗❤️
I love this sooo much
Never thought I&#39;d see Deadpool and wonderwoman in a movie
"The Best ♥️ team <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rednotice"">#rednotice</a> ❤️"
This was hilarious.
POV: U thought It&#39;s Billie Eilish interview 😭🖤
Why does it hurt when I go to the bathroom? The pain...
Done watching movie on Netflix 🥰🥰
"For Ryan&#39;s go to karaoke song, I would have guessed I Swear. He sang it so well in Just Friends. 😄"
We&#39;re calling him &quot;DJ&quot; now?
Oh man... What a fun video.
