Roy is so intense all the time!
"spot on: &#39;job for the boy&#39;<br>or in other words, no one is serious about United winning trophies"
Imagine Harry Maguire holding the Champions League cup over his head by the end of this campaign. See it? 😂
Roy for Manager
Of course he doesn&#39;t care about loyalty. Cause of his fall out with Ferguson and the club. Still bitter after all these years. Lol
"“You want loyalty, get yourself a dog!!”<br><br>Also Keane, “its a dog! Its his job to be loyal!!”"
😂😂😂 didnt hear him saying this when ole was in charge
"United have the money and the players to contend for the title each year, the problem isn&#39;t at club level it&#39;s the board and the owners. We all know, and ed is still there!"
"Ronaldo the worst player in man utd, dun let him play a single match except for europes. This is a performance based football, not charity team who choose players based on name"
Looks like Keane watches the United Stand 👀
YES ROYYY SAY IT HOW IT IS
Check out this QUESTIONABLE take on the gameweek:<br>@
keane is brutally honest but sometimes unreasonably so
I only watch sky sports becAuse of Roy Keane a real pundit who doesn’t need to sugar coat things
"@Roy Keane : Carrick had to abide by Ole&#39;s decision when he was at the wheel. Now Carrick can apply his own decision, proof is he starts Sancho on the right, compared to when Ole was manager he benched Sancho or played him on the left. VDB get to start matches and more playing time under Carrick."
I love Roy Keane...always tell it as it is.
How Keane know about quality
‘If you want loyalty obv you go get yourself a dog’- Keano💯🤣
Shoutout to Mark Goldbridge
"The biggest club in the world was being run by Solsjaer, Fletcher and Carrick. None of which have any experience running a big club. Completely bizarre."
Thank you...finally..
Roy Keane tells the truth
Keane is a legend
Goldbridge would love this comment from roy
Roy is spot on
"Love Keano and he&#39;s one of the most entertaining people to listen to, but he&#39;s an absolute hypocrite here. What were Ole&#39;s credentials and why wasn&#39;t he saying this in the 3 years he was manager?"
Roy is saying they should hire him.
"Roy wants to be &quot;honest and tough&quot;, now that &quot;Wollie&quot; was fired 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Roy Keane is a legendary pundit
I almost enjoy listening to Roy as I did watching him play. He&#39;s so great.
WELL DONE ROY! JOBS FOR THE BOYS IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING AT MAN UTD. NOT THE BEST PEOPLE FOR THE ROLES GETTING THE JOBS!<br> I WOULD LIKE ALL THE MAN UTD FANS TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR COACHING STAFF AND WHAT THEY HAD DONE IN FOOTBALL PLEASE! YOU WILL BE SHOCKED AT THE LEVEL OLE HAS BROUGHT IN. ITS A JOKE! EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN GIVEN JOBS AT MAN UTD FOR NOTHING BUT PRODUCING FAILURE AND RELEGATION IN THERE CAREERS HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE WON A TROPHY?? ALL OF THEM FROM RELEGATION TEAMS OR HAVE BEEN FIRED FOR FAILURE AND THEY ARE REWARDED WITH  THE BEST JOBS THEY WILL EVER HAVE IN FOOTBALL AT MANCHESTER UNITED! FOR FAILURE! ITS A JOKE! GET THEM ALL OUT! ALL OF THEM!
Remember when Liverpool did Jobs for the boys in 1990s . They became Spice boys . The problem was that shithead Jaime Redknapp . Here we have our own Spice Boys . And one of our worst boys is the midfielder Scott Mctominay . Mctominay is the disease destroying Manchester United .
I miss my cockspaniel now who died years ago
Seems Roy also watched goldbridge 😂
"Roy is spot on! Cronyism and nepotism. Fletcher, Carrick etc all mates with each other. Why is the so-called technical director (Fletcher) sat on the bench with an ear piece? Is he a coach? or what? Sack the lot. Nepotism. What qualifications does Fletcher have to be a technical director and a coach. Crazy. And Neville is an enabler of this too. Sky pay him a fortune for his option and he won’t say anything against them. I am so happy he didn’t co-commentate today."
Hasselbaink…..spot on!
Roy is furious
Needed saying. United&#39;s hiring has been a joke. Ralf is a good step to hopefully a better run club.
"I get a feeling, Ralf Ragnick might just hire Roy Keanu once he fully understand how much work he has in his hands at man utd."
"As a Liverpool fan, I would love it if Roy Keane is given a chance to be Man Utd manager."
"The Plans....😂😂😂😂😂...I Love Jimmy, bring Him Back...."
Carrick just as deluded as Ole. When the new manager comes he and the rest of the dead wood should be shown the exit door.
"The new man coming in after today will need to crack a few heads together. They have been SHAMBOLIC the last few weeks, players guilty as much as the manager was  They barely scraped a pass! today. The stats make for the look of a VERY AVERAGE SIDE. Defenders only conceeded 1! 90 million Maguire was OUT! WoW. And it was A SHOCKER FROM the defender for the penalty just when they got in front. Concentration levels must be the worst in the league."
Go &amp; manage a team Roy for hw long are going to be  pundits  bcoz u kno 2 much
Keane is 100% correct!
Roy is Spot On... They Stabbed Ollie in the Back...😒
Keane hit the nail on the head! Finally making some sense!!!
United can win the champions league
brilliant keane. respect your comment genius keane
United can win the champions league
Ole was too soft. So is Carrick
Manu 2 chances. Chelsea 23 chances shots on goal. Now Carrick is pretending to be unlucky! Come on man.
Utd subbed 25 for 7 and City subbed 7 for 25
Carrick was so close to OGS. Always sitting close together during matches. But now he is backstabbing him
"carra turning the heat down for manu,fare play,i dout gary would be so kind"
Hasselbank wants the club&#39;s rivals to say just how amazing Chelsea were? Feck off.
Genuinely believe that if Jose had been given the time Ole got he&#39;d have them as strong contenders for the EPL by now.
Ole is no good ..he was just a waste of time....but and Fredd&amp;mactomin need to change from the midfield...they have no identity
It&#39;s possible to win UCL.
Best pundits  keane and carragher
Roy Keane- sporting Director ✔️
Roy is right as always absolute club legend 💪💪
"No way they make top 4, top 6 maybe."
Kean said everything I’ve been thinking for the last 2 years.
"I agree 100%. Mark Goldbridge said it a while back, its legit &quot;jobs for the boys&quot; at Utd."
replace the somebody he is referring with : ferguson
"😂😂😂😂 roy keane and jamie was absolutely at it but this is why i love football, to have these conversations🤣🤣🤣 i hope they both hugged each other after with no heart feelings."
"“You want loyalty obviously you go and get urself a dog”  🤣🤣😂😂😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=2m36s"">2:36</a>"
True Ole left and everyone working hard all of a sudden
"Carragher can&#39;t stop smirking, the demise of United is too much for him to hold a straight face..😂"
“You want loyalty? You go get yourself a dog” hahahaha!
Kean for pm
He never called out Ole but is calling out Carrick smh
ROY FOR WOKE AMBASSADOR  LEGEND
Half the people sticking up for Roy are opposition supporters loving Keane unhappy &quot;his&quot; team got a well-earned difficult draw after a terrible run. He is giving no credit to a very good result and defensive team performance (McTominey MOM). Most true United fans were pleased after that match and Chelsea needed a penalty to score!
"He says it after solskjaer is sacked. But the entire time he was there he was defending him. Its too late keane to be honest now , too late.Cant respect his opinion. Absolute hypocrith"
Klopp brought in his own staff and has continued to appoint new people throughout his tenure - look at how that is plan has gone
What is this defiance nonsense? The same management team told we will be in the title race until April
You want loyalty you might as well get a dog .. oh man!! 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥
Imagine  roy kean daughter dating one of Ferguson grandson and she invited him for family dinner 😬
I am sure Keano watches United stand
Keane hardly ever questioned Ole until it went really bad. Now Carrick has has two tough games as interim and he is ripping on him. The guy is close mates with Ole. People here licking his ass are deluded.
"Keane talks rubbish. In this match United showed work-rate and played as a team. When Sancho was subbed the Utd fans there BOOED. They were 1-0 up and then the system changed to non-press and Chelsea equalized. It carried on when Rashford was taken off. He was winning free kicks and getting Chelsea players booked coz they couldn&#39;t handle him. Hasslebank says about how Chelsea could have won it, so could have Utd if Fred had done more with that bad kick out by their goalie. Chelsea only scored from a penalty, otherwise their shooting was rubbish. United should have won and their tactic was perfect after a terrible run of form and Chelsea good form. Keane gives no credit to Carrick who dared to drop Ronaldo but it worked!"
"Keane is smouldering that the players have put in effort since Ole got sacked. It&#39;s a loyalty thing, it really gets under this collar!"
Keane looks absolutely livid....haha!!
"I respect Keane, our greatest Captain - sadly all his talk today came 2years too late. Main stream media be better putting ex referee n coaches on panel - some of these ex players are last decade and cant see the game as it be in today&#39;s context. Show analysis instead of talk, why is that a surprise 1-1 when we have not lost at Stamford Bridge for last 5 visits (Ole oversaw 4 of it)"
Bet them chairs aren&#39;t comfy
"What exactly was Hasselbainck baffled by at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=2m13s"">2:13</a>?"
Keano spot on! Even back in our heyday when he called out the prawn sandwich mops..
New song coming “<br>Job for the Boys Boys Boys”
"Whilst I agree with Keane I think it’s personal for him re the jobs for the boys thing. I think it burns him that he’s not working for the club in a desirable role when he probably feels he’s as deserving as Carrick, Fletcher, Ole was etc (which I wouldn’t dispute either)"
"Even a GOAT like Mourinho got sacked, what makes them think ole and carrick can do better lol"
"Love him or hate him, Mourinho has won everything there is to win.. <br><br>The way Man Utd got rid of Mourinho was disgraceful. Mourinho was right back then and he is right even now players like Pogshit aren&#39;t worthy of playing for Man Utd."
Whose this idiot host.  No chance in he&#39;ll united win anything.  This is why they&#39;re so hated.  I&#39;ve never seen more dellusion in my life
"&quot;jobs for the boys&quot; been saying it for years, wrong attitude keane correct to point it out, i think chelsea will win the league and i realise hasselbaink and chelsea fans will be gutted they only got a draw in there cup final but as a united fan we could have scored a few on the counter ultimately really disappointed in the draw but alas if chelsea become champions as i suspect then wont look so bad"
keano has never liked carrick
Ole was positive in interviews where we lost and not once did Keane call Ole out like he did Carrick.
Wan bissaka is not cutting it for me sad but we have to be honest he&#39;s a mess
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=8m00s"">8:00</a> They&#39;re afraid to laugh."
Wink wink 😂😂
&#39;If you want loyalty go get yourself a dog&#39; - Roy Keane
"Roy Keane spot on as always, United got close to that europa league trophy to fail against Man City in the semi final last season Hahahhahahahaha"
As a United fan I&#39;m on the side of getting rid of the coaching staff that&#39;s been lingering around the club from different managers. When you start noticing that we&#39;ve scored once or twice from a corner in 2 seasons you know something isn&#39;t right lol
lol some form of jealousy are around when a young person like Michael Carrick managing big club like ManU.
"You&#39;ll see wherever it&#39;s the biggest commercial product where no one cares about the job or task they&#39;re supposed to be doing, it&#39;s always &quot;jobs for the boys&quot;. Man Utd, Tory Party etc."
"Nepotism and cronyism have been huge problems at United for years and I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s taken pundits so long to point it out. Probably because they were enjoying watching us make fools of ourselves.<br><br>Even before Carrick, United were forcing Moyes and Van Gaal to tutor Giggs for a management role."
When Ronaldo came back United fans dared to dream that United could challenge for the title. Carragher seems to have forgotten that. Fact is Ronaldo couldn&#39;t win the league on his own. Players like Maguire have let United down. Whatever United do this season they are much better off with Ronaldo on the pitch. Carragher should be aware that when it comes to players like Ronaldo age is nothing but a number. Shut up Jamie!
United we’re horrendous. Should’ve been 6-0 Chelsea
Roy didn&#39;t bob and weave. He went in hard and I feel he was 100% right here.
Keeps defending his pal... unbelievable
"There&#39;s an old saying &#39;it&#39;s not what you know, it&#39;s who you know.&#39;"
&#39;&#39;...if you want loyalty you go get yourself a dog&#39;&#39;. CLASSIC. Keano - you&#39;re the best.
Maguire and Mctominay need to go for United to move forward
&quot;Job for the boys&quot; <br>United fans been saying that for years.
Still think 100/1 for Utd to win premiership is worth contemplating  .   Pogba should be captain too
Ronaldo on the bench and Fernandes playing.Laughable.
"Loving Carra&#39;s smirk through this, he knows Keano is spot on."
As always Roy nails it ….jobs for the boys !
Sky Sports at its finest <br>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Spot on Roy.Roy is always spot on. <br>Fletcher,Carrick,what do they know? <br>Friends of Woodward and Fergie or what?And what about the non playing player Phil Jones? If he is not playing,why is he still there being paid for nothing?He&#39;s been around long before Jadon Sancho was born.Somebody upstairs likes him."
"EVERYONE Please pause this video at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=2m14s"">2:14</a> and watch the other pundits faces and the look the give each other. That right there is gold and sums up the TRUTH about Man United."
"if you&#39;d have told Manchester United fans 10 years ago &quot;in 10 years time, you&#39;ll be as good as Barcelona&quot; they&#39;d have taken it. <br><br>So why aren&#39;t they happy now?"
I 💘 keano
Roy speaks of alot of things we hear on UNITED STAND  recently I wonder if he&#39;s been watching lately 😂
Alright goldbridge take off your Roy Keane mask
I never agree with Roy about anything but he’s been speaking my language about the head office it’s shambolic
Who did Ferguson buy to replace Keane?
Roy is the Best Pundit in Sport !!  Hope he is not replaced by a woman !
"TBH , MU players had worked Hard and luck was on MU Side but Carrick is pragmatic to his team sheet and result shows , that&#39;s fair ! No luck will come if all players stop running and MU could be trashed 0:5."
Roy sounds salty that he hasn’t been offered a job there that should be the question I watched him a day ago saying how he would take the job because of his managerial skills he showed at Sunderland and as for hasslebank (get off the tv worst pundit ever) what carrick is doing is giving his players abit of confidence took points of the league leader and probably the best team in the world (right now) Yh he might have got the job as a thank you for your service but as caretaker just let him be he won’t be in the seat for forever
"Man United, Chelsea, Man city, Liverpool are the top teams and one of them will definitely win the league.  Its sad to see how this Man United  play these days really patethic for a top team like man u.Lets see how they play against smaller teams."
Mates rates. You have Darren Fletcher that left that exact same studio doing punditry to a sporting director role at the biggest club in the world. It&#39;s a farce.
I think Ralf should appoint Roy Keane as his number two
United should play with this level of tenacity every single match! The squad is big enough to rotate and rest if some get fatigued.
Lol roy Keane wow said 👍
Some thing wrong some were….. Snides….
Carrick has more self-interest than Manchester United&#39;s interest United needs rid of that last generation that they won the league with Fergie with in order to move on Carrick Fletcher and even Phelan all need to go if we truly want a brand new start with a new style of football.
Hope they continue the old boys stuff so they win nowt.
Silva dived
"You cannot love Roy, only guy in footy that keeps it 💯"
Come on Roy you got one bit wrong. It is who you know and not what you know. That&#39;s everything in life.
Look at Carra’s smug face through this lol.
"Keane u go manage team then, it&#39;s easy to talk."
E go shock all of una Man united for life
Imagine Keane as your da! Waking you up every birthday by whispering in your ear.....&quot;you think you&#39;re special?.....you feel like this is some sort of achievement?&quot;
"Carra&#39;s face from about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=0m05s"">0:05</a> on.... hes buzzin, knowing Roy&#39;s ready to let rip hahahaha..... Priceless !"
Juninho ? I thought he reiterated for like 2 decades ago 😅
"Nice of jorginho to give United a hand I thought. If he wins the Ballon D&#39;Or, footballs dead. As I&#39;ve said numerous times, Chelsea and Italy won the UCL and Euros in spite of him, not because of him"
Need Roy at the training ground keeping the slackers on their toes.
Roy Keane during last season &quot;City are not good enough this season to win the league&quot;.<br>That aged well didn&#39;t it Roy ?.<br>He&#39;s just like G Neville trying to make a name for themselves by slagging off Man Utd all the time.
"«Reconnecting with friends, that is what this club is all about» Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in his farewell interview. «Jobs for the boys» Roy Keane."
This is literally what Goldbridge has been saying for months and yet he gets pelters for it
Saying it how it is. God I love this man.
Spot on Roy for calling it out it’s jobs for boys at united it’s a joke
Hasselbank needs a permanent place as a pundit
Big statement from Roy.
Carricks at the wheel how good does it feel haha
"“You want loyalty, you go get yourself a dog” 👏 what a legend"
"Without Roy Keane, Sky Sports are done for 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Keane just opened that background staff being snitches
5 years ago.<br>United have lost their identity. They need to get some of the players back in the club to bring back United DNA<br><br>Today<br>Jobs for the boys
Carragher was smirking almost throughout the the whole video when everyone else was talking 😂😂
Ragknick gonna have a task ahead of him but hopefully he can flip this season on it’s head👏🏻
"&quot;It&#39;s jobs for the boys, although I should definitely have been considered, Sunderland had a cracking Championship campaign fifteen years ago.&quot;"
Carra with a constant grin👌🏽👌🏽😊😊🤣
Get Goldbridge in if you’re just going to repeat his opinions in an Irish accent
"You can tell Keane played under Brian Clough, a manager who punched his own fans then kissed them after they apologised to him for making him punch them!"
"“If you want loyalty, go get yourself a dog” 😩😭😂 protect Roy Keane at all costs"
You want loyalty get yourself a dog hahahahah
Carrack was wondering did in his pre match interview.  I’m not sure why he’s still at the club to be honest.
I&#39;m starting to think these people hear stuff from Goldbridge. He&#39;s been saying this for a year!
My word he is spot on. The place has turned into a boys club. On ya roy 🙌
I like the way JFH gave a side way  glance to Carragher
“If you want loyalty get a dog “<br>😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Yes, Carrick was with Jose also"
"Carrick was just trying to say all the right things the club wants to hear, positivity. Roy is spot on, it&#39;s all about who you know and protecting the boys. He has been involved with United over many years now and seems like he&#39;s almost stirring the pot in getting managers sacked."
"Its all relative, they lost 4-1 to Watford just last week, a 1-1 draw away to Chelsea a week later is a good result,  at the end of the day Carrick is short term appointment and I&#39;m sure the new appointment will bring their own people in."
SABOTAGE MENTALITY MAN UNITED 🤐
I&#39;d leave me wife and marry Roy Keane. ❤💚🇮🇪☘
No Wonder utd arent getting anywhere. With jobs for the boys.
Can Always rely on keano to speak from his heart. And never minces his words.
Where is Mark Goldbridge when you need him he’s gona be loving this clip been saying this for at least 12 months the only thing clear at United is ‘it’s a job for the buoy’s’ Hurry up Rangnick!!!!
"Exactly the same at Arsenal. Clownteta, Edu, Per, Wilshere, jobs for the boys. Absolute state of both of these clubs is one big fat joke."
"Roy Keane just raised the bar on punditry with the &quot;if you want loyalty, get a dog&quot;."
Keane is pure box office with his analysis makes it worth watching the game.
Comedy gold what manU are going through we all saw it coming when they signed ole
Job for the boys Lmfaoooo killed it
"Roy knows what he’s talking about and the United owners missed the boat in snapping him up as their new manager.<br><br>Maybe it’s not to late to get him but if you ask me, they owe him an explanation as to why they overlooked him in the first place?"
"keano and jimmy are such tough leading men, and also totally correct. So it&#39;s really funny seeing Carra depend carrick, he&#39;s the softie of the group!!!"
Keano been watching a bit of Goldbridge by any chance?
Roy should be paid the highest wage a sky honesty is the best policy no bullshit just speaks the truth
Carrick drew the game against Chelsea - he will be at the wheel permanently in few days
"Mcguire, wan bassaka, mctominay, rashford, telles , lindelof, - none good enough for a Man Utd first 11"
We need Keane in as an assistant manager
lmao Keane is too real
"Get rid of the old boys, great players but we dont need them now"
Left wing soy drinking sjws at Man United these days.<br>You can’t win with that mentality <br>Get woke go broke
Keane watches TUS. Spot on with the cronyism happening at man utd.
Roy is absolutely spot on as usual he always gives a straight talking honest opinion why united are not bending over backwards to get him as manager I will never know Lee Hambleton from Sheffield
Personally Roy should give it a go and become manager until end of the season.
"Fletcher..a nobody, no experience, no pedigree,and just a mediocre player.!!<br>Carrick.. exactly the same !!!... Both no experience, no pedigree in the jobs they somehow have been given ??? Very strange !!..both shouldn&#39;t be in the jobs they&#39;ve got.. parasites !!!"
"The one former player that UTD should have shown loyalty to and didn&#39;t and could probably knock a few heads there in a coaching sense is Roy , the players might need to bring some change with them seeing as he wouldn&#39;t allow them on the bus ."
Confirmed Roy Keane watches the United stand😂 Mark Goldbridge has been calling Utd out for being a &#39;job for the boys&#39; for a while...
"This guy is an overated pundit here for shock value but people eat it all up because it&#39;s the great maestro midfielder Roy Keane. Can we b atleast honest about that?  He was great but a British Gattuso or Nigel De Jong who both aren&#39;t as revered in their respective countries. . In Britain his held in high esteem beyond what Redondo, Edgar Davids or Makelele are even 2 there countries, all by far much better players."
"you can&#39;t not love Keane, with songs like: &#39;is it any wonder&#39;..&#39;everybody&#39;s changing(team effort)&#39;..&#39;the way I feel&#39;.. &#39;nothing to something(tribute to backroom staff)&#39;..&#39;a bad dream(feat olé)&#39;.. &quot;nothing in my way(feat carrick)&#39;..&#39;this is the last time (backing vocals by the fans)&#39;"
IF THE BOARD REALLY WANTED UNITED BACK AT THE TOP THEY&#39;D MAKE ROY MANAGER END OF STORY
"Wow watched this right after the game and you could have heard a pin drop.<br>Jamie smiling to himself (thinking the same thing and agreeing with Roy.).<br>Depending on the future, but a lot of manager bring their own people with them so this group of Coaches/trainers may go, or get found out.<br>Again Roy is right, there needs to be a whole new ethos at the club and the old if not adequate replaced with the better."
"I can&#39;t believe some of the comments...Like, what Honesty are you guys talking about ? You didn&#39;t here anything of what Kaeane said in this Interview when Ole was still at charge, wonder why...Some much delusion, it&#39;s unbelievable."
"get keano back involved in the club, he&#39;ll sort the cnuts out"
&quot;HAVE THE PLANS ONLY STARTED THIS WEEK&quot; hahahahahahahahaha
"Utd today got away with with a thrashing, so so much work to be done there."
Why is Mike Phelan given a free pass? Guy is basically a civil servant at this point.
Roy is 101% correct he always speaks the truth.
Roy Kean it football anything can&#39;t happen
Roy Keane is the truth
"As always, Keano is absolutely correct. Now Ole has gone they need to drain the swamp. Those lads remaining are as culpable as Ole. Ridiculous."
Classic Roy LOL : )
"Keane needs to get a life and get over Manchester United. Those good times are over all the BS about we used to be this we used to be that.<br><br>Used to be.<br><br>Guaranteed he wouldn’t do better. Guaranteed.<br><br>Not an ounce of what can and how can it be done better. Just taking shots from the sideline.  Step up and say what you would do different.<br><br>Grow up, child."
&quot;You want loyalty go and get yourself a dog&quot;
"Totally agree with Roy, the staff should have all been sacked. No one is bigger then the club.  Rangnick might be the start, but there&#39;s alot to do still."
Roy Keane is just brilliant with his assessment of united..he speaks the truth..😲
I wonder if Roy was expecting man utd  to play extra ordinary football overnight. The performance was no excellent but it was better than what they have done for some weeks. They had a plan and did well to keep the shape. Its a step at a time. Even during Sir Alex era there were games man utd did lots of defending and waited for the opposition&#39;s mistakes.
🤯🤯🤯
This kind of insulting outsider take on things is why Keane will never have a job again inside United and why he was kicked out... WHETHER OR NOT he&#39;s right. Which he&#39;s not.
Nothing to be proud of
Coming out with a point is 2 points LOST
Roy kean is what honest commentary looks like 👍🏾 these pundits owe it to the fans to be more like Roy
What is Jimmy&#39;s secret to looking young
Carras smug face every time United are off it 😆
HEATED
Old school keano
I&#39;m an LFC fan but I 100% agree with Keano...all of them should have been cleaned out... the job at United is for somebody with balls the size of an elephant but ruthfulness of an Apex predator... I like Keanos mentality
"Keane&#39;s a loose cannon,love it when everybody starts to feel uncomfortable."
Get ur self a dog 🤣🤣❤️🤣
"Love Keane, speaks absolute gospel 👌🏾"
he is not wrong
Might I ask a question as an arsenal fan. United seem to me like post wenger   Lack of identity plus when ole left it seemed got me he was building something like Ferguson did 30 years ago
Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is the worst pundit I&#39;ve ever witnessed. He is disappointed Chelsea didn&#39;t won so he goes at Carrick!
When did Chelsea sign Juninho
Roy Keane calling how it is yet again. Priceless content.
Keane should have been given the Job
I&#39;m starting to think Roy Keane watches Goldbridge. 🧐😂😂😂
Imagine the gold if they gave roy the job along with an all or nothing documentary for a full season
"so its jobs for the boys when it&#39;s Carrick but when it&#39;s his mate Ole, he doesn&#39;t blame him"
There’s definitely a pal connection at the club which must be dismantled asap. I hope Ralf is the most ruthless person.
"“If you want loyalty, go get yourself a dog”<br><br>Never change, Keano ❤️🤍"
"Nepotism of ex players is destroying the club. Just because they wore the shirt and had success as a player, doesn’t mean they’re qualified for management/coaching jobs."
Arsenal took on arteta and now the clubs  going downhill
"Find it funny how Keane managed to go through the entire reign of Ole at utd without even once truly criticising him and the coaching, and now here we are in the first league game since his sacking and he&#39;s digging out Carrick and the staff. Wonder if the fact that Keane left utd in &#39;05 and Carrick joined in &#39;06 has anything to do with this🤔. I love keane and his rants but he&#39;s as big of a hypocrite as anyone"
I like Roy but at some stage he will have to wake up and smell the coffee and realise its not the halcyon days of MU&#39;s heyday. Constantly harking back to that?? Cmon man at this stage its getting a bit boring lol
Job for the boys 😭🥳😭😂
I&#39;m a Liverpool fan so I was hoping United coukd take points off Chelsea. But it took actually barracking for United in this game as if I was barracking for Liveroool to realise just how bad United is.
&quot;Two words: Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink!&quot;<br><br>                                     - A Commentator
&quot;Jobs for the boys&quot; will replace &quot;that&#39;s his job&quot;😁😁
Can man United win FA cup this season 🙄
"Keanes job for the boys you know, wink wink let’s look after each other 😆 😆"
"Guys, I support Chelsea and I don’t like your comments! Give the job to Carrick plz plz …stop comment against! Ole was doing great now Carrick"
Roy Keane for manager of United!! 🙌
🕵️ for Gary Neville...
Jfh makes zero sense🤣🤣he contradicts himself in the next sentence.
does keane watch Goldbridge
&quot;If you want loyalty in people you go get a dog&quot;
"that 5 second pause to let the statement sink in,,,class. Brave as a lion stands by his observations and a breath of fresh air in football punditry even encourages Carra and Jimmy to speak from the heart ."
Carragher smiling like a proud father
"Ole wasn&#39;t the only problem, there isn&#39;t a single experienced and accomplished staff at MU.<br>Their management is Championship or PL relegation at best."
Lol as if man utd coaching staff need their mortgage payingg
Roy Keane... spot on....   only good thing today was Maguire wasn&#39;t on the pitch.....  allot of people forget that Fergie  on the board ... so anyone hired is given the green light by him ...
Juninho wtf 😬
3.41 ?? Who
"Keano&#39;s a legend but he&#39;s pandering to those who spew the same nonsense online so he&#39;s trying to keep them onside. They all were criticizing Keano when he never spoke on Ole &amp; when diverted attention to the players they said he&#39;s backing his m8 Ole 😄 &amp; now that it suits their narrative they all are like &quot;Roy Keane my captain speaking facts&quot; It&#39;s a circus, Keano is wrong &amp; so are the toxic fans. The truth is somewhere in between."
"This must have been the argument with Carra, but Keane has always had it in with Carrick especially being he’s replacement and taking his number. I remember years back when he criticised Carrick interview calling it flat like he’s performance and Mrs Carrick getting involved on Twitter. Love it!"
So much negativity from a Utd Legend. A draw agaings Chelsea was a good result in this circumstances. If he is so competent he should try coaching and not giving opinions on the studio. Battle is on the field and not in studios.
Keane: I disagree with everything he&#39;s said<br><br>Host: Go on then [say something funny/controversial and make us go viral so we can make more money]<br><br>🙄
"Keane defended Ole for reasons best know by him. He said when he was appointed that it was one for the fans and the same players would get him thrown under the same bus as Jose.  Ole is held in the same esteem at Man U as Keane,  Cantona etc, it’s difficult for anyone connected to the club to be negative. There was a ridiculous hope that Ole would turn it around."
So much hyper analysis for a mid table team 🤔
"I love Keane, speaking the absolute truth. It’s jobs for the boys."
What did the cantankerous old tool want them to do? Replace an entire backroom team between the Watford game at the weekend and the Villarreal game on Tuesday?
"Carragher, grinning like a dope fiend when Roy is on full &quot;Charlie don&#39;t surf&quot; mode is glorious.!:"
"Agree with all the pundits and I also think Carrick has the charisma of a wet dog, jobs for the boys that&#39;s got fergie&#39;s fingerprints all over it YNWA"
That silence when Keane talks. Spot on!
"imagine if maguire played here today, would have probably been a loss with his current form"
"Good points by Roy and Jimmy. But I think they are reading a bit too much into Carrick&#39;s interview. Given all that has happened over the last few weeks, Carrick&#39;s words were almost inevitable."
"If Carrick had no former affiliation with Manchester United prior to getting the job as being part of the backroom staff/coach, would he have got it? Of course not. Would Fletcher even be considered as Technical Director? Don&#39;t make me laugh. The people in these respective positions should be appointed based on merit alone. Carrick and Fletcher have none. It&#39;s obvious that there is a &quot;job for the boys&quot; policy at Manchester United. But props for Keane for pointing it out. Neville would never have the balls to do that."
When Jose wasn&#39;t doing well people wanted someone who knew the United &quot;way&quot; and had that DNA. Now when things go sour with an ex-player it seems professional staff is the way to go. Make your mind up!
"“If you want loyalty, get a dog”- Gordon Gecko"
Keane disagrees with everything… wow
the real question is how long will it take for man utd to realise that with these coaches the team will never go above and beyond.
Wasn’t Roy Keane defending Ole this whole time? when the entire world was saying he isn’t good enough and should be fired <br>Please give me a break
"Really everyone is always up this man&#39;s balls like his some kind of revelation. Failed at managing, fell out with Sir Alex , fell out with some of the players players while coaching Ireland &amp; then let&#39;s not forget left the national squad due 2 blow-up with Mick McCarthy &amp; now his at home as a pundit something his openly criticized and stated he&#39;d never do, well since it&#39;s the only place &amp; establishment that would take you as they thriving off some of the soundbites &amp; capitalize off the type of person he is which is toxic to any other environment.  .  .Keane is basically a walking meme who says some of the most outlandish things and people will eat it all up because his the great Roy Keane, the maestro midfielder, only in Britain."
Absolutely brilliant 💯👍
"I wonder if the influence comes from Woodward. when you look at Man U, It starts from the top, Woodward the banker is mates with the Glazers and he&#39;s mates with Arnold and he&#39;s mates with Murtagh, football level - Ole is mates with Fergie who&#39;s mates with Phelan and mates with Carrick and mates with Darren Fletcher the Technical Director (i&#39;m nearly in hysterics when i hear that) are you getting to see a pattern here. No wonder United are failing as a football club. Get rid of the lot of them and start again. In all honesty, it&#39;s early days for Rangnick (also not confirmed) but if he turns out what people say i wouldn&#39;t mind if after six months he concentrates on the structure of the club and obviously get rid of useless Fletcher (Technical Director, the one that puts the cones out, it seems we now live in a world where we give simple jobs fancy names) and the other coaching staff especially MvKenna and get Red Bull to buy the Glazers out and start running it as a top football club and not an all mates together club and also don&#39;t prioritise making money from the brand name, always football first, the club wouldn&#39;t be what they are if it wasn&#39;t for the fans."
Ridiculous over analysis of a caretaker manager’s second ever post-match interview. Funny how Roy was reluctant to ever go in on Ole after 3 years...
Keane knows what&#39;s going on
You want loyalty go get yourself a dog!!!! HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Keane’s wife : ‘How was work today Roy?’<br>Roy : ‘It’s my job’.
Jobs for the boyssssssss
Roy goes after Carrick but fails to go against Ole when he had the chance
"It’s not Ole FC, Roy."
"Some folks don&#39;t like what Roy says because let&#39;s face it, the truth hurts.  You got ex players in key positions with literally zero credentials to back it up.  This is where the downfall of UTD lies."
"Even as a united fan I&#39;m glad English teams are dominated Europe, just hoping we can get there soon...."
You can see the pain in Roy’s eyes
Roy Keane quoting Gordon Gekko lol
The smile on Carragher&#39;s face as Roy speaks of the dysfunction at ManU and  the player&#39;s complete lack of effort. 😂 😆
"When keane speaks,everyone listens"
i got a feeling Roy watches the United Stand
hes absolutely spot on
U want loyalty then go get urself a dog hahahaha Roy legend
"Carrick has backstabbed Ole ! Suddenly now he has a plan what about the time with Ole where Carrick consulted Ole every single minute and he’s doing literally the opposite things that Ole did ! Starting sancho bailey , benching Ronaldo, Bruno, even van de Beek has been more involved! How can you be Ole‘s right hand for years and all of sudden you are the opposite of him ! Get rid of all of them !"
"Keane  is some chancer, he never once Critised That Fool Ole At The Wheel....."
Roy Keane is so boring
How has Jimmy got the job here bro the guy talks some rubbish
That liverpool result has really cut roy deeeep
I agree 100% with keano but the rest of you questioning fletcher can quit. Fletcher was an essential piece to Manchester United. our midfield got over run when we lost to Barca in the final because he wasn’t in the team. Fletcher knows football and understands United. I think the role is perfect for him
Great man Roy Keane always gonna make ya laugh
Roy(it&#39;s their job)Keane  😆 🤣 😂
What Goldbridge has said for the past three years...
"If Keane became manager, he&#39;d ban ferguson from Old Trafford 🤣"
Love Roy best pundit sticks it too the ManU Playboys. lol
"Roy should be part of the coaching stuff , hands down. We are united dammit."
Keane went on for another 2 hours at the end rhyming off all the faults but they cut him off
Keane ripping the united to shreds and rightly so. The structure of that club is embarrassing.
Keane as a manger for me
Keane should go home and give advice to his wife
Keane is just gold
"Jimmy at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=02m11s"">02:11</a> 😂😂"
Roy Keane fuming with the players the back room staff and everyone at United atm 😂 he didn’t say it when ole was there out of respect and I think in he’s heart he thinks all of oles staff should of walked aswell as him and the fact that they stayed as got to roy
"I like Roy’s honesty, but I see a few jealous people here."
Goldbridge buzzing his opinions finally reaching the media
So funny but true....Glazers probably have no idea who Roy Keane is.
"Keane is straight up. None of this, “oh they’re my mates” bullshit."
Keane should have managed United
Not a penalty!
Until a manager is truly in charge and the most important person at the club untied will fail. While the players have the biggest say united will fail. If a player or players undermined Klopp or Pep they&#39;d be gone. Players undermined Fergie and were immediately gone. United have never truly gave the running of the club to a manager since Fergie left and are paying for it.
"Listen, Man United might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he&#39;s done since he&#39;s come in. Carrick&#39;s at the wheel, man. He&#39;s doing it. He&#39;s doing his thing. MAN UNITED ARE BACK!!!"
Utd will not and cannot win the Champions League.
&quot;Jobs for the boys&quot; - That&#39;s including Gary &quot;fking&quot; Neville.
Well said Roy 👍
I&#39;d love to see Keane get in back in Utd in some capacity where he can trade blows...
Jobs for the bais 😂😂😂👍
Jobs the boys? Looks like some1 had Been watching the united stand
"They all need to go! The coaching is the problem. Roy finally sees and is saying what we the fans have been saying for 2 years plus now. Welcome to reality, the coaching is a joke at United."
Do me a favur
"Carrick meat he is happy not loosing 4-1,5-0,3-1 but it was a 1-1 lol"
Not one player from this Man Utd squad could get position in any of the top three even if they are willing to give money to play. Only and May be Ronaldo might get selected because he can do magic but no one else… it’s not about coaching  even if you put Klopp ot Pep or For that matter Sir Alex …it’s about determination…  and imagination… they are in so much hurry to lose the ball while in position that they cannot think what to do… they have no clear idea.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=3m40s"">3:40</a> JFH still dreaming about the Boro days"
"Bang on Roy, ex Man U running everything, every department. They need proper football men."
Carrick is on the same drugs as Ole
"Fletcher, Carrick, Phelan, Mckenna - these lads wouldn&#39;t get a sniff at another premier league club yet they have jobs for life at Man United. If that isn&#39;t a Boys club I don&#39;t know what is..."
Man utd have the players to win the champions league or fa cup. When you look at teams that have won it in the past it is feasible with new manager
"It&#39;s the same situation at United, talented squad with poor managing, just need a manager"
carrick has a mortgage lmfao. hahahahaha.
Funny how almost every point mark goldbridge makes goes mainstream after a certain amount of time
Keane is going in at Man United now that his pal Ole is gone
Chhelsea pegged em in with a rubbish team no kante no mount no lukaku etc etc
"Keane saying exactly what ive been saying for the last 3 years is THERAPY. Why was Ole ever appointed, Phelan is a dinosaur, Carrick doesn&#39;t even have 6 weeks worth of managerial coaching badges, Darren fletcher has 0 experience to be Technical Director. With Ralph Rangnick coming  glazers need to completely Overhaul the hierarchy for this genius to have his own team then Man Utd are back to the TOP.        Ps Neville and Ferdinand would NEVER say the truth about ole thats why they&#39;ve both become the worst pundits rn Keane is top with Carragher"
&quot;Praising players for doin der jobs&quot; Keane is a legend 😂
Manure a joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
rotten club from top to bottom
Keane is my favourite ever player I loved him as captain but him and neville have damaged there reputations so much by not calling ole out on his tactical mess and to turn so easily on Carrick after winning in Europe with a clean sheet and getting a point away to league leaders after Watford result ..what is he doing what were oles credentials ill never listen to him or neville the same again .. to gave a go at Carrick who doesn&#39;t even want job what a disgrace
"Chelsea was wasteful, da gea saved us.. stupid tactics, MU had no threat upfront.. Fred, da gea, matic, Bailey, Linda the only players that performed today.."
It was an awful 1st hf performance ..
"He’s right but he’s also part of the problem. He’s always calling out and scapegoating players, sometimes correctly but he never called out Ole when he clearly wasn’t good enough."
Phelan OUT
"Carrick and Fletcher need to go.<br>Keane is spot on, they have not earned the jobs they have."
Praising players for doing there job 🤣🤣🤣.
"Carrick and fletcher are clowns, in bed with the Glazers and they certainly dont deserve the jobs they re in right now. They re inexperienced and unqualified. We need to get the interim manager asap - Ragnick !!!"
"I dunno you know, maybe if the new managers comes in and they sign a Dennis Irwin or two they could win the champs league."
Roy should be Man U coach when we wake up tomorrow
Cold..love u kean...next mad max film ur in
"With Shaw and Maguire United conceded 7 goals against Liverpool and Man City.<br>Without them against the other top team, Chelsea,  they conceded 1 goal.<br><br>Just an observation. 🙄🤔"
"chelsea was poor today, on another day could easy of won 6-0"
"Spot on, Roy Keane. Speaking facts, and what most of us fans feel. Thank you for highlighting this."
He’s right. Man United should be better than handing ex-players jobs without merit or them having shown they’ve got the credentials.
Wife - I fed the kids<br>Keane - that&#39;s your job
"1- Carrick never said it was a brilliant performance, he even said &quot;it wasn´t a fantastic all out performance,&quot; he&#39;s just trying to raise the morale after a rough spell. <br><br>2- Managers are not pundits, it&#39;s not their jobs to come out to the flash interview to analyze the game impartially, &quot;jeez we got lucky today, they had great and better chances&quot;, a manager always thinks about team morale first and foremost<br><br><br>3- Keane and Hasselbank are very one note pundits, much prefer Scholes and Hargreaves."
Roy reminds me of Cain dingle
"Jobs for the boys is a perfect way to put it carrick, fletcher, meckenna, ole would never get hired by any other top 10 premier league team. Ole would be lucky if he gets his molde job back."
Viva penaldo 😜😜😜clutch on steroids
the tail is wagging the dog
"I&#39;m curious to know what was with Jimmy&#39;s reaction at around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=2m11s"">2:11</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=2m13s"">2:13</a>. What was that intended for?"
He’s scary but so grateful for him. SAF at the heart of it all
"While Ferguson, Gill, Woodward and the Glacers are there nothing will change. They still want to control the coaching staff, they are all too pally with each other etc"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=00m53s"">00:53</a> you can actually see Roy&#39;s soul partly leaving his body with that 1000 mile stare.<br><br><br>To then return in piece hahahaha"
"Spot on keano,im saying it months,jobs for the boys"
"Whole situation reminds me of my club, Celtic. Job for the boys and kennedy just hangs around like carrick."
It was a 1-1 battering
United lucky to get a point. 24 shots on vs 3. But a point against Chelsea isn&#39;t bad.
These questions from the Sky presenter are laughable
Man utd should appoint roy keane and mark hughes.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=5m46s"">5:46</a> that makes Ole even worse then! If he’s got them doing the coaching and training and you are losing games, and Ole chooses to keep letting them do he’s an idiot."
"Champions League draw is in February. . . question is, how long does Ralf gonna take to implement his style of play. . . United will be the force to reckon with once they get the drip"
"Next match Man Utd lose 0-3 to Arsenal.<br>Carrick: &quot;We lost brilliantly, our players brings out the best of Arsenal.&quot;"
It’s true I hope when Ragnick moves up he gets given the power to get rid of all them
"Ok so they have a mortgage! But that is relevant to their delusional income ! Can&#39;t complain about that,"
"If he was that honest, he would&#39;ve questioned Ole remaining manager there as well ... He gives Ole a free ride cos he played in the same team as him - this doesn&#39;t make him &#39;honest&#39;"
On you go Roy I love it when you spell it out. Pundits are to  protective of players and moddy cuddle them which is pathetic. The bit I didn&#39;t agree with was when Roy said about losing jobs people have mortgages to pay well you definitely won&#39;t see them at food banks with the money they have made.
Just a legend who tells the truth and is 109 percent right jobs for the boys let him sort am allout
"what carrick would have said if rudiger scored<br><br>you know, the boys left everything out there. we defended well and got unlucky its the little details that decide games like this. we had some chances we probably should have finished. <br><br>there ya go"
End of the day Chelski are supposed to have 66% of the play at home pmsl 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
This moderator is trying to shift the conversation. Should&#39;ve asked the panel why there wasn&#39;t a plan when ole was at the wheel.
Seeing the boy Fletcher in his suit wearing a earpiece told us all what we needed to know. Mr blowhard!
Spot on Roy on Carrick .
Somebody has been watching too much Mack Goldbridge 😅.
Wtf is jimmy on about. Has a manager ever came out and said oh yeah the other team was better.
Imagine these United players playing with Roy Keane as there captain or manager 😱😳😭🤕😵‍💫😫🥴
"If you want loyalty, get a dog!  <br><br><b>-Roy Keane</b>"
You want loyalty go get yourself a dog 😂
This was the standard &quot;plan&quot; under Ole. They used to beat the big teams this way. Now they can barely luck out a draw.
He’s made mark goldbridge proud
Thank man u from Liverpool you&#39;ve helped us win the league ?? watch this space
Mcfred is going to be the death of Carrick also freaking idiot
This is exactly how Roy acts ALL the time. When he goes home to his friends / family he&#39;s exactly like this.
Use me as an &quot;that&#39;s his job isn&#39;t it&quot; button
Spot on
Wink - Wink😜😜
What JFH is saying is right but no Utd manager is going to come out and actualyy admit they were &quot;lucky&quot; to get a point. Especially a caretaker who&#39;s desperate to keep his job!
Hmmm didn’t Keano hire a bunch of people from Man Utd and Ireland when he was in the Sunderland job?
Jobs for the boys oh the irony Roy
Look at the glee on Carras face.. he is like &quot; Keane is killing Gary..&quot;
"When Roy Keane left home, he said to his dad, &quot;You are the man of the house now&quot;."
Roy Keane……the point is that it was a soft penalty when you look at all the calls made during the game. Chelsea got away with a lot of fouls throughout the game. Other panelists agreed that that was a soft penalty call. If if if…….the goal that Chelsea scored was from a mistake also guys. Roy seems bitter towards Carrick as the guy got a win and a draw the two match that he picked the team and drop players that Ole refused to drop but he is slagging Carrick while he refused to call out Ole until the very end.
why do these pundits say this stuff months after other people
That one quote he heard was Paul Scholes on BT sports
Keane is spot on time after after.He knows each passing day this club becomes more of a franchise less of a football club.Its a cash cow for the glaziers.
"What is Hasselbank on about? Chelsea had 6 shots on target, United had 2. And of those 6, only 3 were incredible saves by De Gea. The rest of the &quot;good chances&quot; were dealt with by the defense. So yes, it was good defense."
Gwan the lads 🙌
Other than 1993-2013 they’ve never been run that great as a club. Think it’s bad now. Check out the 70s &amp; 80s
This is the type of punditry which is needed pure honest facts.
Anyone who disagrees with Roy tell me why Darren Fletcher has been appointed as a technical director at one of the biggest club in the world based of no experience no cv just because hes friends with Fergie? He’s bang on about the jobs for the boys.
Job for the boys is being said by fans for a while now no proper football people running the club its a joke
where was this honesty when ole was in charge?
Keane is god!
I’m a little heartbroken - I luv Keano now even more than the player and that’s saying something. For him to come out now that Ole has left and talk straight about Ole and his staff when he (and too many of our legends) was tongue tied while Ole was there just shreds the very idea/image of the Roy Keane even rival fans have come to love as a pundit
If Roy Keane was Man Utd manager he&#39;d confront Harry Maguire in the dressing room and tell him &quot;I&#39;m going to take your manhood. You belong in a Greek jail man!!!!&quot;
As ole said FRIENDS 🤡🤡
"Man U is the country club for those connected to the club, past and present.<br>Football is just a by-the-way. Roy is so right in-your-face with his assessment."
you can only rely on Micheal Carricks Manchester desire and experience to a limited extent.<br><br>Only time will tell until the true quality and marksmanship can be relied upon.
"Wasn&#39;t it a &quot;jobs for the boys&quot; comment that created the split between Roy and Fergie, with Roy saying Fergie was getting jobs for his family at United or something like that?<br>Roy definitely isn&#39;t a big fan of nepotism.."
"Roy keane : &#39;you want loyalty, go get yourself a dog&#39;<br>Roy keane: &#39;a dog is supposed to be loyal, that&#39;s their job&#39;"
Yeah Fletcher Technical Director most ridiculous thing
Don’t put butter on it Roy say it how it is 🤣🤣🤣👏🏻
Finally the mainstream media agree it’s ‘Job For The Boys’
"A “job for the boys”, Roy is only now making that point now Ole has gone? Also everything he’s said about Carricks post match interview he could have done for every one of Ole’s"
If man utd can win the next 5 to 7 games in the UCL Big Ears is coming home baby 🤐
Keano only man who doesn&#39;t beat around the Bush. Not gonna get another mam like him in the game footy
God I do love Roy Keane on a rant 😂
there is a reason keane is a pundit and not working a real football job
Why’s he saying this now and not when Ole was in charge? These pundits are agenda driven. Most United fans knew it was too pally pally for the last 2/3 years
"Happens in most working environments, its not what you know, it&#39;s who you know... nepotism at its best<br>Love you keono true legend.."
Job for the boys👬👬👬👬
Wet the beds don’t like Roy Keane cause he intimidates them. Roy speaks facts.
I really hope rangnick bring in some of his own coaches because this is job for the boys mates rates.
Goldbridge has been saying this for months
Irony of him to say this when ex united players like him were the reason ole kept his job for so long
&quot;If you want loyalty go get yourself a dog &quot;Roy Keane
First few minutes he&#39;s so angry he can barely speak 😂
Is roy watching the United Stand?
"Rangnick hopefully will take no prisoners! Carrick been part of the problem for years he should of gone with mouriniho the fact him, McKenna and phelan are on the back room staff is  a crime against the fans and the players!"
Absolute spot on Roy
Nice to see points table stable again thanks Man u.
Rangnick needs a new coaching team
ok i dont get KEANE IF UR GONNA SAY IT FOR THE BOYS WHY CANT U GET OUT OF THAT CHAIR AND MANAGE MAN UTD AND BE A MAN
"wow the most honest guy there is , way to go roy , he&#39;s so right , too pally pally , they should all be questioning each other, look themselves in the mirror !!! the only thing there looking in the mirror for is because of there vanity !!!!"
"&quot;If you want loyalty, go and get a dog&quot; 😂"
Lol the only Man U legend that doesn&#39;t care about this &quot;oh he is a legend he should always be put first &quot; crap
"When I saw Fred and Mctominay playing in midfield, it was obvious that the coaching staff around Ole and Ole himself were/are the problem."
JFH aint got a scoobie
Keane: &quot;Why weren&#39;t they closing down players in the other games&quot;<br>Minutes earlier Keane: Ronaldo has to play. Who cares if he doesn&#39;t press
Man Utd have to sit back against the best team in the world they can’t go toe to toe with them against Chelsea they can get the result but against Liverpool and Man City they will get dominated
Roy = it’s their jobs 😂
Everyone saying oh Keane is honest and he speaks facts. Where was this honesty when everyone knew his mate Ole wasn’t good enough?
Roy Keane needs to be knighted for his honesty on football alone
Love keano!!!!
Roy&#39;s spot on again the club is a mess with this hanging on to the past nonsense and hiring people out of their depth just because they played for us 10 years ago
Roy Keane&#39;s look is golden. 😅😅😅 They have a plan..
Roy keane for presenter of match of the day
roy keane is now  a real estate guy talking about mortgages
you cant ask a manager opinion on a descion cause obviously they are biased if silva kicked awb the same way that awb kicked silva carick would of said thats a pen
Roy still crying Ole got the sack 😭
"Roy Keane is actually so consistent, he got kicked from United for calling out Ferguson about nepotism (jobs for the boys)"
Keano spot on again. Carrick is a fraud and needs to go.
"When his mate Ole was managing it was the players fault for the shitshow, but with Carrick merely doing a placeholder gig until someone comes in now the club&#39;s all about cronyism. Roy blows hot air out of his ass more than a balloon."
This man is not happy...
wtf is carrick meant to say no wonder hes been sacked everywhere hes been
Roy Keane absolutely fuming that Carrick hadn&#39;t been doing Ole&#39;s job for him.
He&#39;s robbed that line of Mark Goldbridge
They’ll be fine. No need to be so dramatic
Happens in most jobs
Keane is goated🐐🐐
The saying not what u know but who I know is so true in every walk of life look at the government for an example cliques are in every business the world ovet
Brutally honest Gary Neville could never
Legend Keano. Always tells it like it is.
"100% Its jobs for the boys, just ask Young Boys LOL."
&quot;If you want loyalty get yourself a dog.&quot; - absolutely lost it
"&quot;If you want loyalty, get a dog&quot; lol 🤣🤣"
"Fletcher technical director, what a joke."
"Keano on point once again. Basically it&#39;s the shadow of Fergie all these years on still looming over the club, still guaranteeing jobs for the boys.  Stay at home Fergie - clean break please United!~"
He wasn’t this harsh on his pal Ole. I don’t get why people like Roy so much. He is repetitive and boring.
"Keano, the original Roy Kent. 😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=0m21s"">0:21</a> The way no one else dares say a word"
"It not just Carrick all the managers stick up for their teams, so not sure want they want him to say, cannot remember any manager talking after the game saying their team were rubbish"
"I love this guy, we have a plan! What plan😂😂😆😆😂😂😆😆😂😎🍺👍"
You want loyalty you go and get yourselves a dog!! 😂😂 Class
If that was penalty then the foul before that should have been called. No penalty...
Roy slating Carrick for praising the players for doing their highly paid job.<br>Presenter thought I&#39;ll ask him if all the back room coaching should of gone with Ole.. 👏 Get Keano ranting 😄
Pump this into my veins 🥲
Juninho 😂 that guy was a baller
Keane is box office. That stare 😆
Spot on from Keane
“If you want loyalty then go get yourself a dog!” 🤣👏
Spot on again Roy. Glazers keeping those they can control in jobs.
"We need pundits like Roy - brutally honest, and calls it as he sees it"
"Roy knows the score, in a world of bullshitters and arsekissers he stands out like a sore thumb"
You have got more chance of finding me than what man utd have got to winning a  trophy this season
I think we can confirm from Keane and Scholes that Carrick isn&#39;t as respected as OGS. 😬 Gloves are off all of a sudden!
"I’ve been squinting a lot too Roy, think you need glasses too pal🙂"
Ole was the ultimate “jobs for the boys” because he’s a nice fella…yet Keane defended him all the way…he is a complete hypocrite
Carrick should just be honest and say they had luck
you could cut the tension with a knife! intensity on and off the pitch by keane
Keane calling out Neville.
"Keane absolutely correct it reminds me of my club Everton where Duncan Ferguson and David unsworth are coaches because they are ex players, sick of it tbh, both clubs need a total overhaul from top to bottom"
Man Utd need to get rid of Harry Maguire. Disgraceful player and even worse captain. Far better team without him.
The fact Ferguson still has a say in the club is a joke in itself get the whole lot of them out of the club and I’m a Arsenal fan
"One thing about Keano is you can&#39;t bs around him. Always speaks his mind, respect to him"
Spot on no pr bullshit
Keane should have been in that dressing room and rattled the bat!! He`s spot on!
The “pals thing” at man united also stretches to the United pundits too
Where was this energy when ole was there roy .....lol bunch of hypocrites
&quot;Jobs for the boys&quot; Same thing goldbridge has been saying for months😂
Did he just say the coaching staff still have mortgages? Carrick? Phelan? Fletcher 😂😂 bull$hit. Maybe McKenna
Roy Keane a bully who got called out for a straightener by Jonathan Walters and lost his nerve.
It&#39;s been jobs for the boys the last 3 years.  I see Neville&#39;s been given the day off.
"United got a point, they could of been slaughtered today easily"
Just give Roy the keys to the castle 🏰 Let him rule Old Trafford with an iron fist 👊🏼 Fergie mark 2!! Just imagine that! Carnage 🤣
"Can always rely on Keane to be very upset after a United team gives a very un-United performance, at least from what he expects."
Savage punditry?  That’s my job.
Carrick is delusional! Further these so called managers are so embarrassing they are dragging this team into the dirt all for personal financial gains! No one cares if they have mortgages. YOU are NOT GOOD ENOUGH!
"Neville should have been sacked off Sky same day Ole got sacked from Manchester United. His opinions are irrelevant now. He&#39;s already proven that his football knowledge of the game at this level is laughable after his stint at Valencia. Get him off and give men who truly represent our club more air time, Roy Keane being 1of them 💯"
Jimmy and Jamie at 2.15 😂
"If you want loyalty, get a dog. <br>Brilliant"
It’s the way keane looking at Jamie 😂😂😂😂😂😂
ROY KEANE WATCHES GOLDBRIDGE <br>CONFIRMED
"Funny how Keane was so reluctant to criticize Ole n then talking abt Job for boys.. yes Ole is Keane’s boy!! Such a delusional statement.. Keane will always be my fav player, but not pundit"
I bet Roy wished he was one of those boys he speaks of:)
"Wouldn’t surprise me if they win champions league, typical Man U"
Funny how he says this AFTER ole&#39;s been sacked. Wonder why he didn&#39;t speak his mind while the guy was in charge 🤷‍♂
"Keane knows fergy is pulling the strings behind the scenes and is a bit sour haha, reminds me of the time he called Fergy out for getting his son a medal hahaha"
My Dad heads to the shops and never returns ...<br>Roy &quot;That&#39;s his job!!&quot;
"After carefully listening to this, I have to say there is one thing I really really agree with Roy Keane on......Dogs are amazing"
"The fact they’ve kept all the coaching staff that put these players though poor training is laughable, but were happy throw Ole under the bus. The owners are a bigger problem. They didn’t have a single contingency for sacking Ole, and now hoping Carrick can continue to coach a poor form  United. And this whole “getting ya best pals in” is unbelievably true. It’s the single biggest fact here. They’re all in it. If there weren’t, the top would’ve dropped others alongside Ole... but they didn’t. Keane is bang on again. Saying it how it is, and so he should. 💪🏻"
Jamie has achieved 100 % smugness. look at him smirk. 100% t**t
It&#39;s cos they&#39;re white they can&#39;t win...
FOR TEH BOIS
"2-0 loss to city: “not Ole’s fault the players are rubbish”<br>1-1 v Chelsea: “no credit to Carrick, where was this previously”<br>Roy protects ole more than neville"
From the look of things they coaches have been very soft with the players
You could hear a pin drop in that studio
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvC1c-3tWw4&amp;t=0m21s"">0:21</a> I think Roy had a malfunction for a second there 😂"
roy for motivation coach!!! )
I agree. Bring back Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes.
Keane speaking facts
Cara absolutely dying to laugh all the way through this
&quot;if you want loyalty go and get yourself a dog&quot; 😂👌
Best captain ever and best pundit ever.
Roy Keane for Prime Minister.....
"Keane the man that threw ireland under the bus, ferguson under a bus, now carrick, nearly ended haalands career - shouldnt be near the telly - he is a disgrace"
"Fairplay Roy , call it out !   Jobs for the boys !!!!!!"
Carrick can say whatever he wants because he knows 99% of the clubs&#39; fans know sod all and will think they should deserve to win the game
"Roy is such a legend , well done for calling out that weasel carrick he should have been sacked before ole ."
@Mark Goldbridge has been saying this for years. But good that the legends are spotting this aswell
What a horrible game from United I’ve never seen a team play with 3 CDM lmao wtf was that even. They need to clean out that whole staff. I am pretty sure they all influenced Ole’s decisions when setting up the formation. They should have cleaned out the whole staff hopefully this will happen. Manu has some quality players that they could use to set up a really dangerous team but they really need to change that mentality!
He’s been watching goldbridge
Guardiola &quot; SIT DOWN NOBODY TALKS&quot;<br><br>Roy Keane &quot; I&#39;m standing up. What now?&quot;<br><br>Guardiola &quot;😢😢😢&quot;<br><br>De bruyne &quot; LET ME TALK&quot;<br><br>Roy Keane &quot; Be silent forever&quot;<br><br>De bruyne &quot; 😢😢😢&quot;<br><br>Mourinho &quot; 3 Premierships. RESPECT RESPECT MAN&quot;<br><br>Roy Keane &quot; 50 legs broken. What do you have to say now?&quot;<br><br>Mourinho &quot; I prefer not to speak. If I speak I am in big trouble and I don&#39;t want to be in big trouble&quot;
Spot on Roy. Carrick is mates with the owners and Ferguson. Carrick is on the coaching staff forever.
Jobs for the boys!!!
Keane with an absolute brilliant take. ‘Job for the boys’ is so true. What credentials does Fletcher have to be Technical Director? What’s Carrick done to be a UTD coach?
&#39; You want loyalty go and get a dog &#39;. Never a truer word spoke.
Surely these guys don’t have mortgages 😆
"Keane is speaking facts. People like Ole and Carrick being anywhere near a job for Manchester United staff is proof its just a job for the boys, mates rates."
Sky Sports is a Man United Hand Rub Fest
Hasslebaink was spot on that was definitely not a brilliant performance.
AWK-Ward
Wink wink ;)
Bloody hell how did hasselbanks gets those tree trunk thighs into those tight pants
Roy Keane is just the best on this channel
Hasselbanks got massive legs
Roy “That’s his job” Keane
“That’s their job”😂😂
About time someone in the media said it
Why didn’t Keane say this when Ole was here?
I heard Carrick phoned Frank for help
Make him the manager already or at least a coach.
Cr7🏆🏆
Roy Keane watches Mark Goldbridge confirmed?!!
Keane on smoke
"&quot;You want loyalty, you go get yourself a dog&quot;"
SPOT ON
Santa clause delivers presents to children<br>Roy Keane: That&#39;s his job
Roy Keane is the gift that keeps on giving. Absolutely love the honesty he brings to Sky Sports
He’s spot on. It is jobs for the boys.
Roy Keanes Wife: I Love you so Much<br><br>Roy: That’s your Job
Keane is honest more often than not. Blunt &amp; honest
"Yeah, but this applies to Ole as well. Keane is only saying it now because his friend isn&#39;t there anymore lmao"
I wouldn&#39;t even let you on the bus home
Whats the plan
Keane needs to go on an anger management course
Michael Carrick LOVES RONALDO
✌
First
